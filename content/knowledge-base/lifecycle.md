All software follows semantic versioning of `X.Y.Z`.

* A major release is a change in the first digit and usually indicates breaking API changes or, in the case of 1.0.0, indicates the first release where the API is considered complete (-enough) and stable.
* A minor release is a change in the second digit and usually indicates new features added, and usually also includes bug fixes that might not have been released yet in a previous patch release.
* A patch release is a change in the third digit and only contains bug fixes, no new features.

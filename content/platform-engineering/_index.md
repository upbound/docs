Platform engineering refers to the set of practices, tools, and services that enable organizations to design, build, and operate a technology platform. The platform purpose is for either internal or external use. The platform provides self-service provisioning, standardized workflows, automated resource management, and governance. These platforms streamline software delivery and operations by abstracting away complexity. Complexity may come in the form of multi-cloud deployments, networking, security, compliance, and more. These platforms improve time-to-market and enhance reliability.

As a leader in platform engineering, Upbound provides a Kubernetes-native approach to resource automation through its open source Crossplane project. While widely used for building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), Upbound's approach extends beyond IDPs to power SaaS platforms and industry-specific resource platforms. 

Upbound enables teams to define, provision, and manage cloud resources via Kubernetes APIs. This simplifies multi-cloud orchestration, automates tenant provisioning, and enforces governance at scale. Upbound accelerates the journey for organizations looking to scale their platforms efficiently while maintaining full control over their infrastructure.

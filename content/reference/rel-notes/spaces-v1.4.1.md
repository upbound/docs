#### What's Changed

- We added missing RBAC permissions for `up migration import` to work against a Spaces MCP.
- We improved the reliability of group creation in a connected self-hosted space.
- We fixed a bug impacting hub authorization when a Space is deployed on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.

    THIS IS AN ALPHA FIELD. Do not use it in production. It is not honored
    unless the relevant Crossplane feature flag is enabled, and may be
    changed or removed without notice.
    ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
    take on the managed and external resources.
    This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
    release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
    values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
    custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
    See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

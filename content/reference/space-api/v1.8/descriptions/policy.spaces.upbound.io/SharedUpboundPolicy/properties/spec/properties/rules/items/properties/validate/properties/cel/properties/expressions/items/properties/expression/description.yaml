    Expression represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL.
    ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec
    CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request/response, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:
    
    - 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests.
    - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.
    - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/admission#AdmissionRequest)).
    - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.
    - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources.
    - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
      For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
    - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
      See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
    - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
      request resource.
    
    The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the
    object. No other metadata properties are accessible.
    
    Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible.
    Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression:
    - '__' escapes to '__underscores__'
    - '.' escapes to '__dot__'
    - '-' escapes to '__dash__'
    - '/' escapes to '__slash__'
    - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
    	  'true', 'false', 'null', 'in', 'as', 'break', 'const', 'continue', 'else', 'for', 'function', 'if',
    	  'import', 'let', 'loop', 'package', 'namespace', 'return'.
    Examples:
      - Expression accessing a property named 'namespace': {'Expression': 'object.__namespace__ > 0'}
      - Expression accessing a property named 'x-prop': {'Expression': 'object.x__dash__prop > 0'}
      - Expression accessing a property named 'redact__d': {'Expression': 'object.redact__underscores__d > 0'}
    
    Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].
    Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
      - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
        non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
      - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
        are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
        non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
    Required.

    SharedSecretStore represents a shared SecretStore projected as ClusterSecretStore
    into matching ControlPlanes in the same namespace. Once projected into a ControlPlane,
    it can be referenced from ExternalSecret instances, as part of `storeRef` fields.
    The secret store configuration including referenced credential are not leaked into the
    ControlPlanes and in that sense can be called secure as they are invisible to the
    ControlPlane workloads.

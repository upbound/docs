    Type of the authentication to use. Options are: None, Basic
    (username/password), BearerToken, SSH. Default is None. The corresponding
    fields must be set for the chosen authentication type.
    
    
    If you are looking to use OAuth tokens with popular servers (e.g.
    GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) you should use BasicAuth instead of
    BearerToken. These servers use basic HTTP authentication, with the OAuth
    token as user or password.
    Check the documentation of your git server for details.

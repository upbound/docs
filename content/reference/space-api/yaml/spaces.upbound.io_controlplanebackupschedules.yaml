        description: "ControlPlaneBackupSchedule represents a Velero Schedule on a
          ControlPlane. Creating a ControlPlaneBackupSchedule creates a Velero Schedule
          on the ControlPlane referenced at Spec.FromControlPlane. The referenced
          ControlPlane must be in the same namespace as the ControlPlaneBackupSchedule.
          The Velero Schedule backs up user-accessible control plane API resources,
          and is configured with the ControlPlaneBackupSchedule's schedule, TTL, and
          storage location. Deleting the ControlPlaneBackupSchedule deletes the Velero
          Schedule. Deleting a ControlPlaneBackupSchedule does not delete backups
          created from the Velero Schedule, which will continue to persist until they
          reach their TTL. A ControlPlane may have multiple ControlPlaneBackupSchedules
          writing to the same storage location. \n If the control plane backup feature
          gate is enabled, a ControlPlane will receive a corresponding managed ControlPlaneBackupSchedule
          named \"<controlplane-name>-default\". The schedule will save daily backups
          of the control plane's API resources to the control plane's default backup
          storage location. Backups will be garbage collected after 7 days. Any edits
          to the schedule will be reverted when the ControlPlane is reconciled."

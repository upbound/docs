    [[GATE:EnableControlPlaneClasses]]
    Class specifies the class of the control plane. This affects the
    control plane sizing, including component replicas and resource
    requirements. There are multiple predefined classes, with 'default'
    being the standard Spaces control plane without any additional class
    configuration. Check the Upbound Cloud documentation for a list of all
    available classes. Defaults to 'default'.

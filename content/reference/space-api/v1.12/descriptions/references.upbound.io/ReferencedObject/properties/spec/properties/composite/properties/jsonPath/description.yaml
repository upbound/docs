    JSONPath is where the reference is stored in the composite.
    The reference is resolved in the context of the claim.
    The JSONPath is expected to end with a object field called `*Ref`, or
    an array field called `*Refs`. In the former case, the object field must
    have the following schema. In latter case, each item in the array must:
    
    apiVersion: string
    kind: string
    name: string
    namespace: string # optional, defaults to be a local reference.
    UID: string # optional
    grants: []string # optional, defaults to ['Observe'], but can hold any of
                       ['Observe', 'Create', 'Update', 'Delete'].
    claims: []string # optional, additional verbs the user must be authorized to.
    
    Grants are a closed-set, corresponding to the management policy of
    Crossplane. Grants are authorized through RBAC and Upbound ReBAC for the
    referenced object when creating or updating a reference.
    
    Claims are optional verbs the user creating or referencing an object
    must be authorized to. These can include custom verbs.
    
    With grants the user specifies the permissions that the claim gives to the
    composite: 'Observe' allows the composite to read the object, 'Create' to
    create it, 'Update' to update it, and 'Delete' to delete it.
    
    Claims tell the composition author about additional permissions the user
    might have.
    
    OpenAPI v3 validation and defaulting can be used to restrict and/or
    auto-populate the fields.
    
    A JSONPath must have a counterpart schema in the CompositeResourceDefinition's
    references.upbound.io/schema annotation.

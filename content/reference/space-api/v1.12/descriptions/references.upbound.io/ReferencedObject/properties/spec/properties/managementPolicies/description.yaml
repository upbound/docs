    THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
    through a Crossplane feature flag.
    ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
    take on the managed and external resources.
    This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
    release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
    values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
    custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
    See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

    Schedule defines the scheduling result of the resource group. It is
    set by the scheduler and cannot be mutated by the user. But the user
    can unset it to allow the scheduler to reschedule the resource group.
    
    If unset, the resource group will be rescheduled by first setting the
    proposed schedule in the status and then setting this field here.
    
    If no scheduling is possible, the Ready condition will be set to False
    with the NoControlPlaneAvailable reason.
    
    A schedule will never change unless the user unsets it.

    This field contains the requested additional information about each object based on the includeObject
    policy when requesting the Table. If 'None', this field is empty, if 'Object' this will be the
    default serialization of the object for the current API version, and if 'Metadata' (the default) will
    contain the object metadata. Check the returned kind and apiVersion of the object before parsing.
    The media type of the object will always match the enclosing list - if this as a JSON table, these
    will be JSON encoded objects.

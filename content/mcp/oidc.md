description: A guide for authenticating managed control plane with external services, including using OIDC
---

Managed control planes use [Crossplane providers](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/providers/) to interact with external services. External services could be hyper scale cloud providers, version control services, ticketing platforms, or anything else that has a public API. Control planes can connect to an unlimited number of external services--just as long as there's an associated Crossplane provider in the [Upbound Marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers).

## How to connect to an external service

### Install a provider on your control plane

Install a Crossplane provider on your managed control plane by declaring a dependency on the desired provider package in your control plane's [configuration]({{<ref "concepts/control-plane-configurations.md" >}}) source.

### Configure the provider

Crossplane providers use a [`ProviderConfig`](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/providers/#provider-configuration) Kubernetes object to supply credentials to authenticate with external services. For example, [Upbound's AWS provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws/latest) offers a [`ProviderConfig`](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws/latest/resources/aws.upbound.io/ProviderConfig/v1beta1) that supports [supplying credentials](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws/latest/resources/aws.upbound.io/ProviderConfig/v1beta1#doc:spec-credentials-source) via a Kubernetes `Secret`, environment variable, file, and more.

### Connect to multiple accounts within a service

You can create multiple `ProviderConfig` objects for a single provider in a managed control plane. You can create new ProviderConfigs on your control plane via the Upbound Console or by [connecting directly]({{<ref "/mcp/#connect-directly-to-your-mcp">}}) to your control plane and creating new ProviderConfigs on it.

For example, imagine you have `team-a` and `team-b` sharing a single managed control plane. Suppose each team should only be able to create resources in their respective cloud account in AWS. You would create two ProviderConfigs as demonstrated below:

```yaml
# This is the ProviderConfig that will get used by team-a
apiVersion: aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: team-a-config
spec:
  credentials:
    secretRef:
      key: credentials
      name: team-a-account-creds
      namespace: upbound-system
    source: Secret
---
# This is the ProviderConfig that will get used by team-b
apiVersion: aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: team-b-config
spec:
  credentials:
    secretRef:
      key: credentials
      name: team-b-account-creds
      namespace: upbound-system
    source: Secret
```

When a team creates resources with the control plane, reference the appropriate ProviderConfig to use from the `spec.providerConfigRef` field of any managed resource.

{{<hint "tip" >}}
The example above demonstrates ProviderConfigs using simple account credentials. **Don't use this auth method for production purposes.** Instead, configure your providers to use Upbound Identity, which is based on OIDC and described below.
{{< /hint >}}

## Use OpenID Connect with Upbound

Providers in Upbound managed control planes can also use an `Upbound` credential source called **Provider Identity**. The `Upbound` credential source uses OpenID Connect (`OIDC`) to authenticate to providers without requiring users to store credentials on Upbound. This authentication method is comparable to ["workload identity"](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) offered by some managed Kubernetes services.

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/) is a protocol that's built on top of [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/). It serves to establish the identity of an entity in one environment that's attempting to access resources in another.

### Configure Upbound identity for a provider

To configure a provider on a managed control plane to use Upbound Identity, use the auth method called `Upbound`. Exact configuration varies depending on the provider. Find examples below for AWS, Azure, and GCP:

#### Upbound identity for AWS example

First, [add Upbound]({{<ref "quickstart.md#connect-to-your-cloud-provider-with-openid-connect" >}}) as an OpenID Connect provider in your AWS account. Then, create a ProviderConfig on your control plane with the following configuration:

{{< editCode >}}
```yaml
apiVersion: aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  credentials:
    source: Upbound
    upbound:
      webIdentity:
        roleARN: $@<arn:aws:iam::12345969492:role/your-role>$@
```
{{< /editCode >}}

#### Upbound identity for Azure example

First, [register Upbound]({{<ref "quickstart.md#connect-to-your-cloud-provider-with-openid-connect" >}}) with Azure Active Directory in your Azure account. Then, create a ProviderConfig on your control plane with the following configuration:

{{< editCode >}}
```yaml
apiVersion: azure.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  clientID: $@<client-id>$@
  tenantID: $@<tenant-id>$@
  subscriptionID: $@<subscription-id>$@
  credentials:
    source: Upbound
```
{{< /editCode >}}

#### Upbound identity for GCP example

First, [configure Upbound]({{<ref "quickstart.md#connect-to-your-cloud-provider-with-openid-connect" >}}) for workload identity federation in your GCP account. Then, create a ProviderConfig on your control plane with the following configuration:

{{< editCode >}}
```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  projectID: $@<your-gcp-project>$@
  credentials:
    source: Upbound
    upbound:
      federation:
        providerID: $@projects/<project-id>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<identity-pool>/providers/<identity-provider>$@
        serviceAccount: $@<service-account-name>@<project-name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>$@
```
{{< /editCode >}}

### OIDC explained

OIDC calls the two parties the **OpenID Providers (OPs)** and **Relying Parties (RPs)**. Managed control planes define these roles as follows:

- **OpenID Provider**: Upbound
- **Relying Party**: an external service that supports OIDC, for example, AWS, Azure or GCP

Users set up a _trust relationship_ between Upbound and the external service. Upbound uses the trust relationship instead of storing credentials for an external service in the managed control plane.


Upbound injects an _identity token_ into the file system of every provider `Pod`. Upbound sends the token to the external service and exchanges it for a short-lived credential. Upbound uses the short-lived credential to perform operations against the external service.

#### Creating trust relationships

Every OIDC relying party implements its own mechanism for establishing a trust relationship and associating permissions. Typically, the process involves the following broad steps:

1. Specifying the _issuer_. For Upbound, this is `https://proidc.upbound.io`.
2. Specifying an _audience_. This may vary by relying party.
3. Creating a role or service account that an entity possessing a valid identity
   token can assume.
4. Associating permissions with the role or service account.

Different OIDC relaying parties may define valid tokens differently. Typically it involves writing a policy that restricts what _subject_ can assume the role or service account.

{{<hint "warning" >}}
Authoring a policy with appropriate access controls is critical to ensure that only your provider in your managed control plane is able to assume the role or service account.
{{< /hint >}}

Identity tokens are [JSON Web Tokens (`JWTs`)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519). The OIDC _claims_ supported by Upbound are available in the OIDC metadata endpoint at `https://proidc.upbound.io/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://proidc.upbound.io",
  "jwks_uri": "https://proidc.upbound.io/.well-known/jwks",
  "response_types_supported": [
    "id_token"
  ],
  "subject_types_supported": [
    "public"
  ],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
    "RS256"
  ],
  "claims_supported": [
    "sub",
    "aud",
    "exp",
    "iat",
    "iss",
    "jti",
    "nbf"
  ]
}
```

OIDC relying parties use this information to validate identity tokens. Relying parties use the `jwks_uri` to ensure that the OIDC provider signed the identity token with their private key. The private key must correspond to one of the public keys from `https://proidc.upbound.io/.well-known/jwks`.

The `iss` and `aud` claims of an identity token should match the _issuer_ and _audience_ configured for the relying party. The `sub` should be a valid _subject_ based on the authored policy. For providers running in Upbound managed control planes, the _subject_ adheres to the following format.

```
mcp:<account>/<mcp-name>:provider:<provider-name>
```

For example, the following would be a valid _subject_ for `provider-aws` in a managed control plane named `prod-1` in the `my-org` account.

```
mcp:my-org/prod-1:provider:provider-aws
```

The claims for an identity token injected into the file system of a provider in a managed control plane looks like the following.

```json
{
  "iss": "https://proidc.upbound.io",
  "sub": "mcp:my-org/prod1:provider:provider-aws",
  "aud": [
    "sts.amazonaws.com"
  ],
  "exp": 1680124165,
  "nbf": 1680120565,
  "iat": 1680120565,
  "jti": "YL1ouQ5KJiTY2QShIRczqQ=="
}
```

{{< hint "tip" >}}
Identity tokens injected into a provider `Pod` are valid for 1 hour. They are automatically refreshed before expiration to ensure there is no interruption in service.
{{< /hint >}}

## Add Upbound OIDC to a Crossplane provider

Any provider that can run in a managed control plane can support the `Upbound` credential source. Upbound injects identity tokens into the file system of every provider `Pod` whether they support OIDC or not. A provider wishing to support OIDC can access its identity token in the `/var/run/secrets/upbound.io/provider/token` file.

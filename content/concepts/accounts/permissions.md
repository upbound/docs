description: "Permission levels for Upbound organizations"
---

Upbound's access model is organization-based. To perform an action within Upbound, users must belong to an organization that has the appropriate permissions.

Upbound splits the permissions model into organization-level and team-level permissions. Organizations allow users to have one of two roles: users are either **Admins** or **Members**.

- **Admins** can view and change all repositories, teams, members and robots.  
- **Members** can only view resources admins grant access to.  

## Admins

Organization admins have every available permission within the organization. Permissions include:

- Repository management (create repositories; push packages; download private packages)
- Manage membership (invite or remove users from the org; manage assigned roles)
- Team management (create teams; assign permissions; associate robots; team settings)
- Robot management (create robots; delete robots)
- Organization settings
- Delete organizations
- View and interact with the Upbound console

## Members

Members can only view resources that admins have granted access to. They can't create robot accounts or teams. They also don't have permission to view the Upbound console.

Upbound uses four different categories to manage identities: 

- [Users]({{<ref "./users" >}}) - Accounts representing a single user.
- [Organizations]({{<ref "./organizations" >}}) - A top-level collection of
  users and teams. 
- [Teams]({{<ref "./teams" >}}) - A sub-group within an organization. 
- [Robots]({{<ref "./robots" >}}) - Non-user accounts designed for
  automation.

Some features of Upbound, like [publishing packages]({{<ref "upbound-marketplace/packages" >}}), are only available to registered Upbound users.

Register and manage Upbound accounts at [accounts.upbound.io](https://accounts.upbound.io)

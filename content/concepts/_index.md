Upbound builds on the foundations of Crossplane to allow you to provision,
compose, and consume infrastructure with the Kubernetes API. Upbound also
integrates a UI console to simplify organization management. With the addition
of managed control planes, Upbound allows you to centralize your resource
orchestration.

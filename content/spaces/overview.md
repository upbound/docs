description: A guide to Upbound Spaces
---

Upbound Spaces are hosting environments for Upboundâ€™s managed Crossplane control planes. It enables users to transform a Kubernetes cluster into an Upbound-enabled hosting environment. You can run control plane spaces in your own environment--whether that's a hyper scale cloud provider or an on-prem data center. As long as there's a Kubernetes cluster, you can run a control plane space in the cluster.

## Spaces and Upbound

Think of Upbound's SaaS environment as one giant control plane space, operated and managed by Upbound. With control plane spaces exposed as a feature, users of Upbound can now create their own self-hosted space. With spaces, users offload the management burden of operating Crossplane to Upbound while still enabling them to:

- scale their own control planes independently
- have more than one instance of Crossplane running in a Kubernetes cluster
- specialize and scope control planes to different use cases
- manage their lifecycle
- backup and restore
- and more--all from your own environment.

## Key benefits

Control plane spaces give you:

- XP Control Plane are first class citizen process with full scaling, observability, management
- Seamless Git integration. Store the definition of your API in a Version Control Service of your choice, allowing teams to integrate with Git pull request and review flows which engineers know and love to build their platform APIs.
- Enterprise ready and highly scalable
- Creating a control plane space from an existing Kubernetes cluster is a seamless operation. All you need is a Kubernetes cluster.

description: A tutorial to configure a Space with Argo to declaratively create and manage control planes
---

In this tutorial, you learn how to configure [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) to communicate with a self-hosted Space. This flow allows you to declaratively create and manage control planes from Git. Argo CD is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that you can use to drive GitOps flows for your control plane infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- Have already deployed an [Upbound Space]({{<ref "spaces/quickstart/kind-deploy.md" >}}).
- Have already deployed an instance of Argo CD on a Kubernetes cluster.
- The [up CLI]({{<ref "reference/cli/#install-the-up-command-line" >}}) installed on your local machine.

## Connect your Space to Argo CD

Fetch the kubeconfig for the Space cluster, the Kubernetes cluster where you installed the Upbound Spaces software. You must add the Space cluster as a context to Argo.

{{< editCode >}}
```ini
export SPACES_CLUSTER_SERVER="$@https://url$@"
export SPACES_CLUSTER_NAME="$@cluster$@"
```
{{< /editCode >}}

Switch contexts to the Kubernetes cluster where you've installed Argo. Create a secret on the Argo cluster whose data contains the connection details of the Space cluster.

{{< hint "important" >}}
Make sure the following commands are executed against your **Argo** cluster, not your Space cluster.
{{< /hint >}}

Run the following command in a terminal:

{{< editCode >}}
```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: space-cluster
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster
type: Opaque
stringData:
  name: ${SPACES_CLUSTER_NAME}
  server: ${SPACES_CLUSTER_SERVER}
  config: |
    {
      # configure this section!
    }    
EOF
```
{{< /editCode >}}

{{< hint "tip" >}}
Read the [Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#clusters
) to see examples of configuring clusters for various cloud providers' managed Kubernetes services

## Create an Argo Application

Use the Argo CD `Application` resource to represent a Git repository which contains `kind: ControlPlane` configuration objects you want deployed in your Space.

Keeping your context pointed at the Argo cluster, run the following command in a terminal:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: control-planes
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/upbound/spaces-reference-arch.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: infrastructure
    directory:
      recurse: true
  destination:
    name: ${SPACES_CLUSTER_NAME}
EOF
```

This application points at a sample repository which contains a configurations for 3 managed control planes destined for deployment to a Space.

## Inspect the Space

Once you kick off a sync operation, Argo syncs the desired control planes from Git to your Space cluster. You can confirm this by querying the Space with `up`:

```bash {copy-lines="1"}
up ctp list -A

# The output should look like this:
GROUP     NAME          CROSSPLANE    SYNCED   READY   MESSAGE   AGE
default   ctp-dev       1.13.2-up.3   True     True              9d
default   ctp-staging   1.13.2-up.3   True     True              9d
default   ctp-prod      1.13.2-up.3   True     True              9d
```

Now you can declaratively create new control planes in your Space, update existing ones, or delete them by committing desired state to your Git repository.

Upbound is the industry's first platform for building internal cloud platforms. Designed around control planes, Upbound offers a new way for building an internal cloud platform, purpose-built for your organization. Customers can build, deploy, manage, secure, and use their platforms all from a single point of control.

Upbound provides a commercially supported version of Crossplane as well as tools and features to simplify the life of operators and developers, including:

* [Universal Crossplane (UXP)]({{<ref "uxp">}}) - UXP is an [open source](https://github.com/upbound/universal-crossplane) Crossplane distribution managed and maintained by Upbound.
* [up command-line]({{<ref "cli">}}) - The Upbound `up` command-line enables interacting with Upbound managed control planes and simplifies common workflows such as installing UXP or building a Crossplane package.
* [Upbound Marketplace]({{<ref "upbound-marketplace">}}) - Upbound Marketplace is a collection of maintained and community Crossplane `Providers`, configurations and API documentation.

Official providers are open source and available to all Crossplane users.

Support for official providers follows the [product lifecycle]({{<ref "reference/lifecycle">}}) and support policy of other Upbound components.

More information is available on the [support page]({{<ref "../../support.md" >}}).

## Versions

Official providers have two relevant release numbers:

* Provider release, for example, `provider-aws:v0.17.0`
* Custom Resource Definition (*CRD*) API version, for example `v1beta1`

## Provider releases

Upbound releases new providers to provide bug fixes and enhancements. Provider versions follow standard semantic versioning (*semver*) standards of `<major>`.`<minor>`.`<patch>` numbering.

**Major version** changes have significant changes to provider behavior or breaking changes to general availability CRD APIs.  

**Minor version** changes expand provider capabilities or create breaking changes to `alpha` or `beta` CRD APIs. Minor versions never change general availability CRD APIs.

**Patch version** changes are bug fixes. Provider capabilities and CRD APIs aren't changed between patch versions. 

<!--
### Custom resource definition API versions
The CRDs contained within an official provider follow the standard Kubernetes API versioning and deprecation policy. 

* `v1alpha` - CRDs under `v1alpha` haven't passed through full Upbound quality assurance. `v1alpha1` providers are for testing and experimentation and aren't intended for production deployment.

* `v1beta1` - This identifies a qualified and tested CRD. 
Upbound attempts to ensure a stable CRD API but may require breaking changes in future versions. `v1beta1` may be missing endpoints or settings related to the provider resource.

* `v1beta2` - Like `v1beta1` CRDs all `v1beta2` providers are fully qualified and tested. `v1beta2` contain more features or breaking API changes from `v1beta1`. 

* `v1` - CRDs that reach a `v1` API version have fully defined APIs. Upbound doesn't make breaking API changes until the next provider API version.

## Release cadence

Upbound releases new versions of the Official Providers on the last Thursday of
every month, except for critical bug or security fixes.

You can find an overview of the provider releases on the
[releases page]({{<ref "releases.md" >}}).

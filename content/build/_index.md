{{<hint "warning">}}
Configurations built using control plane projects require Crossplane v1.18 or
newer. They will fail to install on older versions of Crossplane.

Authoring and building control plane projects is the best way to get hands-on
experience with Upbound.

This section teaches you how to:

- Create a control plane project and add providers and other dependencies
- Author an API
- Author compositions and composition functions
- Build and push your control plane projects
- Test and run your control plane projects

To get started, create a new [control plane project]({{< ref
"control-plane-projects/">}}).

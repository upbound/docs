Creating your own, customized API is a core differentiating feature of Crossplane and is a critical step in your Crossplane journey. This guide defines the best practices to follow when developing custom APIs using Crossplane's core building blocks. 

{{< hint "important" >}}
If you are not already familiar with core Crossplane concepts, we recommend first reading the upstream [Crossplane concepts](https://docs.crossplane.io/master/concepts/) documentation.

## Overview

Crossplane gives you the tools to extend the Kubernetes API without needing to write code. According to the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/), "The Kubernetes API lets you query and manipulate the state of API objects in Kubernetes (for example: Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Events)."

Customers use Crossplane because they want to declaratively create and manage resources in an external service. "Resources in an external service" can be many things:

- a traditional cloud resource like an IAM role or a VM instance
- a git repo on GitHub
- a database in a SQL server instance

To put this into context, Kubernetes has a component called the `API Server`. This is the front door you must go through to interact with various objects in Kubernetes. The API Server needs to know how to interact with resources which exist outside of a Kubernetes cluster.

## How Crossplane enables managing resources in an external service

In the examples above, each resource has API that can be used to interact with them. You can teach Crossplane how to interact with their APIs. **Crossplane providers** are the building blocks that you can install into Crossplane to teach it how to talk to these resources' APIs. Crossplane providers are packages which bundle and define new Kubernetes custom resources and their associated controllers (that contain the logic for interacting with the external resource's APIs). We call these `managed resources (MRs)` in Crossplane.

Managed resources are Kubernetes objects, complete with manifests that are like any other Kubernetes object--They support versions, labels, metadata, etc. Here's an example manifest of the `Server` resource courtesy of the Crossplane provider-azure. 

```yaml
apiVersion: dbforpostgresql.azure.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: Server
metadata:
  name: azurepostgresql
spec:
  forProvider:
     administratorLogin: sqladmin
    location: West Europe
    skuName: GP_Gen5_2
    sslEnforcementEnabled: true
    version: "9.6"
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    namespace: upbound-system
    name: azure-postgresql-conn
```

Crossplane managed resources attempt to be a 1:1 representation of an external resource in Kubernetes. Installing managed resources into a Crossplane via a Crossplane provider doesn't constitute a custom API; you create a custom API in Crossplane by defining `composite resource (XRs)`, a unique concept to Crossplane.

{{< hint "important" >}}
ðŸ“¢ Just like any Kubernetes object, you can create new Crossplane managed resources directly. We advise **against** doing this in favor of always using Crossplane composite resources, explained below.

## What constitutes a custom API with Crossplane?

As the [upstream Crossplane](https://docs.crossplane.io/master/concepts/) documentation calls out, when it comes to building custom APIs with Crossplane, there are a few components involved:

1. A **Composite Resource Definition (XRD)**
2. A **Composition** or **Compositions**
3. A **Configuration** Package

{{<img src="xp-arch-framework/images/xp-building-blocks.png" alt="Depiction of Crossplane building blocks" size="small" quality="100">}}

A Composite Resource Definition and composition together give Crossplane enough information to be able to form Composite Resources (XRs).

### What's a composite resource (XR)?

Composite resources are Kubernetes objects that you can create without needing to write any code and which define a new API abstraction above Crossplane managed resources. Composite resources are user-defined. While managed resources are powerful, there are some limitations:

- High-fidelity APIs mean there are a lot of things to configure in each Managed Resource. Could we pre-configure some of the resources?
- In many cloud deployments, multiple Managed Resources are required. Can we combine them into a single Resource?
- In many cases weâ€™d like to abstract the resource. Can users ask for a Database instead of a cloud-provider specific DB?

Composite Resources solve these problems. A composite resource requires:

- A **Composite Resource Definition (XRD)** to be authored
- A **composition** to be authored, which is the implementation component of your composite resource against the XRD (which is the definition). You can have multiple compositions that implement an XRD, but 1 implementation will always be selected when creating a new instance of the composite resource.

{{<img src="xp-arch-framework/images/xrd.png" alt="Depiction of an XRD" size="small" quality="100">}}

For example, you could define a custom API called `StorageBucket` and you could have three different implementations of this resource, one for each public cloud provider.

### What does it mean to compose something?

Managed resources should never be created directly. Instead, you create them indirectly as part of composing them with Composite Resources. Not only does this allow you to craft a custom API above the managed resource, it also lets you create a relationship between multiple related managed resources, stitch values between them if needed, adds additional RBAC capabilities and lifecycle management controls.

## Configure APIs on a control plane

A new instance of Crossplane is like a blank slate: there are no custom APIs installed. You need to install packages that deliver custom APIs which implenent the functionality you desire. This could be a package someone else authored or it could be a package that you have authored yourself. `Control plane configurations` are one of the core building blocks defined by Crossplane and are the recommended package format for distributing APIs onto a control plane. To learn about using configuration packages, read [creating control plane configurations]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/building-apis/building-apis-configurations.md" >}}).

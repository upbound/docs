This reference architecture provides a recommended baseline scoped to deploying a single Crossplane control plane. This architecture isn't focused on a workload or role to be served by the control plane, rather it concentrates on the control plane itself. The information here is the minimum recommended baseline for most Crossplane control planes.

{{< hint "note" >}}
ðŸ’¡ An implementation of this architecture is available on GitHub: <link to a configuration on Marketplace>. You can use it as a starting point and are encouraged to tweak it according to your needs.

## Configure compute for hosting Crossplane

Because Crossplane is built on the foundation of Kubernetes, you need a Kubernetes cluster to install Crossplane into. 

Crossplane providers create new Kubernetes APIs to represent external cloud APIs. These APIs are Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Crossplane providers are the implementation and delivery vehicle for these CRDs. Crossplane providers vary in the number of CRDs they define; some only define a few, while others may define hundreds. With consideration to large Crossplane providers, installing many CRDs creates significant CPU and memory pressure on the API Server of your control plane. Therefore, failure to size the Kubernetes control plane nodes can lead to API timeouts or control plane pods, including UXP, to restart or fail.

In managed Kubernetes environments such as AWS EKS or GCP GKE, you donâ€™t control the Kubernetes control plane nodes. As a result, each managed Kubernetes provider handles the resource needs of Upbound providers differently.

<What is the specific configuration recommendation? How many nodes in a node pool, how big of nodes?>

## Configure your control planeâ€™s API

Once you have Crossplane installed into a Kubernetes cluster, you need to configure it to expose the APIs you want. You do this by installing Crossplane providers, configurations, and your own compositions. Read the [building APIs](./building-apis.md) portion of the framework for guidance on building custom APIs with Crossplane.

While control planes can be configured by applying these objects directly using `kubectl`, we recommend as a best practice using a single git repo as the source of truth to hold the entire definition of your control plane's configuration. This allows you to use a GitOps tool such as Flux or ArgoCD to continuously apply the latest definition of your control plane configuration.

## Tenant Isolation

Many users create control planes that have multiple consumers. Suppose you are building a platform that has 10 teams who will use your control plane to create resources. In this example, each consuming team is a "tenant". It is security best practice to avoid showing information of other teams and isolation each team 

In this baseline single control plane architecture, if you want to isolate tenants, you must use Kubernetes namespaces.

## Add secrets management

Secrets in Kubernetes are objects that hold sensitive data like passwords, tokens and keys. Crossplane uses Secrets to store sensitive information, such as credentials for Crossplane providers, inputs to managed resources, or connection details. If you do not configure Crossplane to use an external secrets store, these secrets will be written to a namespace in a control plane. Just as with Kubernetes, reliance on in-cluster secrets are not considered a best practice. Therefore, our architecture baseline recommends configuring your control plane to use an external secrets store.

ðŸ’¡ External secret store feature support was introduced as an alpha feature in XP v1.17 and later. Our archicture's recommendation assumes you are running this version of Crossplane or later.

## Authentication & Authorization

Most enterprise users have a central Identity Provider they use to federate their orgâ€™s access to cloud resources. Most cloud providersâ€™ Kubernetes identity integrations allow them to integrate their roles with Kubernetes-native RBAC.

## Add policy engines

An effective way to manage Crossplane is to enforce governance through policies. Any Kubernetes-compatible policy engineâ€“-such as [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) or [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno)â€“-can be installed into Crossplane. This allows users to write custom policies to enforce against Crossplane resources. 

When setting policies, apply them based on the requirements of the control plane. Do you want to Audit or Deny the action? In Audit mode, the action is allowed but it's flagged as Non-Compliant. Have processes to check non-compliant states at a regular cadence and take necessary action. In Deny mode, the action is blocked because it violates the policy. Be careful in choosing this mode because it can be too restrictive for the workload to function.

Don't apply custom policies directly to the control plane. These policies are part of your control planeâ€™s total configuration and should instead be defined in your control planeâ€™s git repo source of truth (recommended earlier) and administered control plane that way. To learn more about creating custom policies, see [Create and assign custom policy definitions]().

## Consume control plane APIs

Your control planeâ€™s API can be consumed in a variety of ways. For users who are building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), they typically have UI-based form experiences to collect information that needs to be passed over to a control plane to action upon. Other users may want to have ServiceNow be their frontend interface. If you read and follow [the guide]() for building custom APIs, this means you need to create Crossplane claims on the control plane.

The baseline architecture recommends designating a git repo to be the source for all Crossplane claims that should exist on a control plane. Similar to configuring the definition for your control planeâ€™s configuration, this pattern allows you to use GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux to continuously sync the resources that are desired from your control plane. For this architecture to function properly, the interfaces to your control plane need to be able to create Crossplane claim .yamls and submit it to the repos being monitored by your GitOps tooling.

To learn more about integrating frontend interfaces to your control plane, see [frontend integrations]().

## Monitor and collect metrics

Crossplane is capable of emitting Prometheus metrics, so users can install Prometheus to sit alongside Crossplane and configure it to scrape metrics for the core Crossplane component and provider pods. Users can integrate these metrics with Grafana to visualize metrics, logs, and alerts. 

Thereâ€™s a lot of missing knowledge in the community for how to interpret these metrics, though. Same goes for debugging issues in Crossplane.

## Business continuity

To maintain business continuity, define the Service Level Agreement for your control plane. An effective tool to help you achieve your SLAs is through Velero. Velero allows users to capture and backup the state of their infrastructureâ€™s configuration on their control plane. In a disaster scenarioâ€“such as if the control plane were to go offlineâ€“users can provision a new instance of Crossplane and restore the last known state up to the time of the most recent backup. 

To learn more about using Velero to achieve disaster recovery, read [backup and restore control planes with Velero].

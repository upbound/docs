This reference architecture provides a recommended baseline architecture for deploying and operating many Crossplane control planes. When users choose to adopt a control plane architecture that involves multiple control planes, those control planes usually have specialized roles. Two things that need to be considered when running many control planes are:

1. What are the boundaries that cause you to specialize a control plane's role?
2. How do you bootstrap and manage the infrastructure that supports each control plane? 

In a multi-control plane architecture, we recommend a hub-and-spoke model: use a central (hub) control plane whose job is to create specialized control planes (spokes). This pattern is also sometimes called ‚Äúcontrol plane of control planes‚Äù.

Just like the baseline single control plane architecture, the solution you ultimately arrive upon will be influenced by your business requirements, and as a result it can vary depending on what you are trying to achieve. The architecture and recommendations in this doc are a starting point for you to branch off of.

üí° An implementation of this architecture is coming soon! You will be able to use it as a starting point and will be encouraged to tweak it according to your needs.

## Central (hub) control plane

The multi-control plane architecture involves creating a control plane to serve as a hub whose exclusive job is to manage the specialized control planes (spokes). This architecture is a hub-and-spoke pattern and you will somestimes hear it called ‚Äúcontrol plane of control planes‚Äù. The hub control plane follows the [single control plane]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-single.md" >}}) baseline architecture.

### Configure the hub control plane

The hub control plane should be configured in the following ways:

- **APIs:** the only APIs that need to be installed are for creating other control planes (and the infrastructure to back them). To do this, it should be able to create new Kubernetes clusters, install Crossplane into them, and create credentials for each control plane.
- **cloud account access**: if you plan to deploy control planes into multiple cloud accounts, it needs to be configured accordingly to have access to do this.

The hub control plane otherwise follows the standard architecture we encourage for [baseline control planes]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-single.md" >}}):

- the control plane configuration definition should be sourced from git, built as a package and deployed via GitOps engine.
- claims, which should be created for each specialized (spoke) control plane, should be sourced from git and deployed to the hub control plane via a GitOps engine. 

## Specialized (spoke) control planes

When you create multiple control planes, each control plane's role is usually specialized based on some business requirements. We've documented below the main reasons you may want to consider using multiple control planes and associated tradeoffs:

- [Cross-environment requirements]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#specialize-control-planes-by-environment" >}})
- [Cross-cloud requirements]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#specialize-control-planes-by-cloud" >}})
- [Segment by organizational unit]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#specialize-control-planes-by-organizational-unit" >}})
- [Cloud account segmentation]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#specialize-control-planes-by-cloud-account" >}})
- [Performance requirements]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#performance-requirements" >}})
- [Isolation requirements]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#tenancy-requirements" >}})

It's important to note you may combine approaches from this list. For example, you may have cross-environment _and_ tenant isolation requirements. 

{{< hint "tip" >}}
If after reading this page, you are unsure of whether you need to create multiple control planes, our recommendation is to start simple and try to operate with just a [single control plane]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-single.md#configure-your-control-plane" >}}). You should only begin to look at a multi-control plane architecture when you have strong business requirements to do so or your usage exceeds the capacity of a single control plane.

### Specialize control planes by environment

This approach means you create a control plane on a per software environment basis. This would mean 1 control plane for dev, 1 control plane for staging, 1 control plane for production, etc. Each control plane has a specialized responsibility to only manage resources in its designated environment.

**Reasons to apply this approach:**

- you want to follow software development best practices.
- you deploy software--and cloud resources--across non-prod and prod environments.

**Tradeoffs:**

- Your control plane footprint increases linearly for each environment you want to support.

### Specialize control planes by Cloud

This approach means you create control planes on a per hyperscale cloud provider basis. For example, if you needed your platform to operate in both AWS and Azure, you would create at least two control planes:

- a control plane whose responsibility is for handling AWS-related resources
- a control plane whose responsibility is for handling Azure-related resources

**Reasons to apply this approach:**

- your organization's cloud consumption spans multiple cloud providers.
- your disaster recovery plans for your platform require sustained operation if one hyperscale provider suffers from an outage.

**Tradeoffs:**

- Your control plane footprint effectively doubles.
- By nature of this specialization, you don't treat your control plane as being multi-cloud resource capable (which Crossplane is capable of doing). Depending on the hyperscale provider you want to interact with, you need to change control plane contexts.

### Specialize control planes by Organizational Unit

This approach means you designate a control plane to an organizational unit boundary. Many organizations have their own approach to defining their org structure; when we say "organizational unit," we mean some grouping of individual application teams. For example:

- Teams Alpha, Bravo, Charlie use _control-plane-x_
- Teams Delta, Echo, Foxtrot use _control-plane-y_

**Reasons to apply this approach:**

- This is usually done for tenancy reasons, which we explain in [tenancy requirements]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#tenancy-requirements" >}}) below.

**Tradeoffs:**

- Your control plane footprint scales with the number of organizational units you onboard. Depending on the size of your org, this could bring considerable operational overhead.

### Specialize control planes by Cloud Account

This approach means you create a control plane on per cloud account basis. By cloud account, we mean a specific billing account (AWS Account, GCP Project, Azure Tenant, etc). Crossplane is able to communicate with external APIs only after a Crossplane provider has been installed in the control plane. 

Crossplane providers themselves rely on `ProviderConfig` objects to configure and provide authentication details for how to interact with the external service. We explain in [tenancy requirements]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-multi.md#tenancy-requirements" >}}) below the ways you can set up ProviderConfigs on a control plane to control and give tenants access to provision resources in single or multiple cloud accounts.

**Reasons to apply this approach:**

- You have business requirements to demonstrate a tenant is _only_ able to provision or interact with resources from a designated set of cloud accounts.
- You have security requirements to lock down control planes to designated cloud accounts.

**Tradeoffs:**

- It's hard to estimate how this impacts your control plane footprint, since that's heavily dependent on how strongly your organization has adopted cloud accounts to group/segment your cloud resource usage.

### Performance Requirements

This use case is driven by necessity rather than strict business requirements. A single Crossplane control plane has inherent performance characteristics and limitations. If your platform usage will cause you to exceed those performance boundaries, you will have no other choice than to distribute the load across multiple control planes. 

**Reasons to apply this approach:**

- you anticipate serving more tenants on a control plane than we've measured it can handle.

**Tradeoffs:**

- You need to create a strategy and method for sharding usage across your control planes.

### Tenancy Requirements

Sharing control planes can save cost and simplify administrative overhead. However, much like a shared Kubernetes cluster, shared control planes introduce potential security and performance concerns. In the [single control plane architecture]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-single.md#tenancy-on-your-control-plane" >}}), we explained what tenancy means in Crossplane. If you have security requirements to ensure certain teams are only able to create resources in certain cloud accounts, we strongly recommend adopting a multi-control plane architecture that segments teams to their own control planes.

## Configuration

For each individual control plane, this architecture applies the same recommendations as what you can find in the [baseline single control plane architecture]({{< ref "xp-arch-framework/architecture/architecture-baseline-single.md" >}}). The difference is that once you have your hub control plane created, you can use it to declaratively create all ensuing specialized control planes.

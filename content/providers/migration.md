Upbound maintains migration tooling to support customers migrating from either
community providers or the monolithic Official Providers to the new family
provider architecture.

The tooling further supports the upgrading from one version of an Official
Provider to another when there are breaking API changes.

## Migrating from community to Official Providers

{{<hint "note" >}}
Upbound's migration tooling for helping customers transition from community
providers to Official Providers is still in development. Please check back or
contact an Upbound representative for the latest updates. In the mean time you
can follow the manual migration guide below.
{{< /hint >}}

### Manual migration guide to official providers

This document describes the steps need to migrate from the community providers
to Upbound's Official providers.

For the sake of simplicity, the guide only focuses on migrating managed
resources and compositions. You can extend these scenarios with other tools
like ArgoCD, Flux, Helm, Kustomize, etc.

#### Migrating managed resources

Migrate existing managed resources to the official providers through import
scenarios. The aim is to switch the community provider's scheme to the official
providers and apply those manifests to import existing cloud resources.

To prevent a conflict between two provider controllers reconciling for the same
external resource, the old provider gets scaled down. The
[pause annotation feature]( https://github.com/upbound/product/issues/227)
achieves the same goal by pausing the reconciliation of the old provider.

1. Backup managed resource manifests

    ```bash
    kubectl get managed -o yaml > backup-mrs.yaml
    ```

1. Update deletion policy to `Orphan` with the command below:

    ```bash
    kubectl patch $(kubectl get managed -o name) -p '{"spec": {"deletionPolicy":"Orphan"}}' --type=merge
    ```

1. Install the Official provider
1. Install the ProviderConfig
1. Update managed resource manifests to the new API version `upbound.io`,
external-name annotations and new field names/types.
You can use the [Upbound Marketplace] for comparing CRD schema changes.

    ```bash
    cp backup-mrs.yaml op-mrs.yaml
    vi op-mrs.yaml
    ```

1. Scale down Crossplane deployment

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deploy crossplane --replicas=0
    ```

1. Scale down native provider deployment

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deploy ${deployment_name} --replicas=0
    ```

1. Apply updated managed resources and wait until they become ready

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f op-mrs.yaml
    ```

1. Delete old MRs

    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f backup-mrs.yaml
    kubectl patch -f backup-mrs.yaml -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
    ```

1. Delete old ProviderConfig

    ```bash
    kubectl delete providerconfigs ${provider_config_name}
    ```

1. Delete old provider

    ```bash
    kubectl delete providers ${provider_name}
    ```

1. Scale up Crossplane deployment

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deploy crossplane --replicas=1
    ```

##### Migrating VPC managed resource

The diff below shows the required changes to migrate a community provider-aws
VPC resource to an Official provider-aws VPC. Note the changes to the
API version and some field names/types in spec and status sub-resources.
To find out which fields to update, compare the CRDs in the current
provider version and the target Official provider version.

```diff

```

#### Migrating Crossplane configurations

Along with the managed resource migration, you update the composition and claim
files to match the new CRDs. First start to import the existing resources to the
Official provider and then update the configuration package version to point to
the Official provider.

1. Backup managed resource manifests

    ```bash
    kubectl get managed -o yaml > backup-mrs.yaml
    ```

1. Scale down Crossplane deployment

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deploy crossplane --replicas=0
    ```

1. Update deletion policy to `Orphan` with the command below:

    ```bash
    kubectl patch $(kubectl get managed -o name) -p '{"spec": {"deletionPolicy":"Orphan"}}' --type=merge
    ```

1. Update composition files to the new API version `upbound.io`, external-name
annotations and new field names/types. You can use the [Upbound Marketplace] for
comparing CRD schema changes.
1. Update `crossplane.yaml` file with official provider dependency.
1. Build and push the new configuration version
1. Install the Official provider
1. Install the ProviderConfig
1. Update managed resource manifests with the same changes done on composition
files

    ```bash
    cp backup-mrs.yaml op-mrs.yaml
    vi op-mrs.yaml
    ```

1. Scale down native provider deployment

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deploy ${deployment_name} --replicas=0
    ```

1. Apply updated managed resources and wait until they become ready

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f op-mrs.yaml
    ```

1. Delete old MRs

    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f backup-mrs.yaml
    kubectl patch -f backup-mrs.yaml -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
    ```

1. Update the configuration to the new version

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
    kind: Configuration
    metadata:
      name: ${configuration_name}
    spec:
      package: ${configuration_registry}/${configuration_repository}:${new_version}
    EOF
    ```

1. Scale up Crossplane deployment

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deploy crossplane --replicas=1
    ```

1. Delete old ProviderConfig

    ```bash
    kubectl delete providerconfigs ${provider_config_name}
    ```

1. Delete old provider

    ```bash
    kubectl delete providers ${provider_name}
    ```

##### Migrating VPC in a composition

In the below, there is a small code snippet from platform-ref-aws to update VPC
resource.  

```diff
   resources:
     - base:
-        apiVersion: ec2.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
+        apiVersion: ec2.aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
         kind: VPC
         spec:
           forProvider:
             spec:
               region: us-west-2
               cidrBlock: 192.168.0.0/16
               enableDnsSupport: true
-              enableDnsHostNames: true
+              enableDnsHostnames: true
-              tags:
-              - key: Owner
-                value: Platform Team

+                Owner: Platform Team
+                Name: platformref-vpc
       name: platformref-vcp
```

The following PRs are examples which show a migration of the existing
platform-refs:

- platform-ref-aws: <https://github.com/upbound/platform-ref-aws/pull/69>
- platform-ref-azure: <https://github.com/upbound/platform-ref-azure/pull/10>

## Migrating from monolithic to family Official Providers

Two ways exist to migrate from Monolithic providers to Family providers.

{{<hint "important" >}}
Users who will use the Automated method should carefully review the
Pre-requisites section of the relevant part.
{{< /hint >}}

### Manual migration

The Upbound official [provider families]({{<ref "providers/provider-families">}}) organize provider resources into common, logical, groupings.
Provider families replace the original monolithic providers, which combined all provider resources into a single Provider package.

Migrating from a monolithic provider to a family provider allows the family provider to take ownership of existing managed resources.

{{<hint "important" >}}
Upbound only supports migration from Upbound's official monolithic providers at present.

Support for migration from Crossplane community providers to Upbound provider families will be available for Upbound customers in the near future.
{{< /hint >}}

#### Backup existing Crossplane resources

Backup the existing Crossplane resources including managed resources, Compositions and Claims.

In case of problems, Crossplane can restore the resources from the YAML files.

{{<hint "note" >}}
This may take over 10 minutes depending on the number of managed resources in the cluster.
{{< /hint >}}

```bash 
kubectl get managed -o yaml > backup-mrs.yaml
kubectl get composite -o yaml > backup-composites.yaml
kubectl get claim --all-namespaces -o yaml > backup-claims.yaml
```

#### Update the resource deletion policy

Update the deletion policy on all managed resources to `Orphan` to prevent
Crossplane from deleting the resources.

Find any resources that are already set to `Orphan`.

```shell
kubectl get $(kubectl get managed -o name) -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.deletionPolicy=="Orphan") | "\(.spec.forProvider.tags."crossplane-kind")/\(.spec.forProvider.tags."crossplane-name")"'
```

Save the names of any returned resources.

Next, set the deletion policy of all managed resources to `Orphan`.

```shell
kubectl patch $(kubectl get managed -o name) -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"Orphan"}}' --type=merge
```

{{<hint "note" >}}
These commands may take over 10 minutes depending on the number of managed resources in the cluster.
{{< /hint >}}

#### Create a list of family provider services

Upbound maintains a migration script that maps all existing managed resources to their family provider packages.
This script generates a list of new family providers to install.

1. Download the script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upbound/extensions-migration/main/docs/generate-manifests.sh
chmod +x generate-manifests.sh
```

2. Run the script to generate a list of provider family packages. The script
   produces two files, `sp-family-manual.yaml` for the new family configuration provider
   and `sp-manual.yaml` for the required individual family providers.

{{<hint "note" >}}
The script relies on `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
{{< /hint >}}

```shell {copy-lines="1"}
./generate-manifests.sh
Generating manifests from current cluster
```

The files set the `revisionActivationPolicy` on each provider to `Manual` to prevent the providers from competing over the resources.

#### Install the new family configuration provider

Apply the `sp-family-manual.yaml` generated by the script to your cluster.

```shell
kubectl apply -f sp-family-manual.yaml
```

Verify the `upbound-provider-family-<name>` provider is `INSTALLED: False` and `HEALTHY: True`.

```shell {copy-lines="1"}
kubectl get providers
NAME                          INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PACKAGE                                               AGE
upbound-provider-aws          True        True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-aws:v0.27.0          26m
upbound-provider-family-aws   False       True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-family-aws:v0.36.0   6m56s
```

{{<hint "note" >}}
Family providers use a single `provider-family-<name>` Provider to manage ProviderConfig objects across all resource providers in the same family.
{{< /hint >}}


#### Install the family resource providers

Use the `sp-manual.yaml` file to install the providers for each resource.

```shell
kubectl apply -f sp-manual.yaml
```

Verify the resource providers are `INSTALLED: False` and `HEALTHY: True`.

{{<hint "note" >}}
This example only uses a single resource, {{<hover label="s3" line="4">}}s3{{</hover>}}.
{{< /hint >}}

```shell {copy-lines="1",label="s3"}
kubectl get providers
NAME                          INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PACKAGE                                                AGE
upbound-provider-aws          True        True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-aws:v0.27.0           30m
upbound-provider-aws-s3       False       True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-aws-s3:v0.36.0       5s
upbound-provider-family-aws   False       True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-family-aws:v0.36.0   10m
```

#### Remove original Providers as a Configuration dependency

Check for any installed Configurations.

```shell {copy-lines="1"}
kubectl get configurations.pkg
NAME                       INSTALLED   HEALTHY   PACKAGE                                           AGE
upbound-platform-ref-aws   True        True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/platform-ref-aws:v0.5.0   3h14m
```

{{<hint "important" >}}
If you don't have an installed Configuration skip to [delete the monolothic provider](#delete-the-original-monolithic-provider).
{{< /hint >}}

Remove any Configuration dependencies on the original Provider to prevent it from being automatically reinstalled.

{{< editCode >}}
```console
kubectl patch configuration.pkg $@<CONFIGURATION_NAME>$@ -p '{"spec":{"skipDependencyResolution": true}}' --type=merge

```
{{</ editCode >}}

##### Remove the Crossplane lock

Edit the Crossplane Lock object and remove the old Provider.

```shell
kubectl edit lock lock
```

Remove the `packages` array item where `type: Configuration` and `dependencies[0].package` is the monolith provider.

{{<expand "An example Lock before editing" >}}
```yaml

    version: v0.32.0
```
{{< /expand >}}

#### Delete the original monolithic provider

Now delete the original monolithic Provider.

{{< editCode >}}
```console
kubectl delete provider.pkg $@<PROVIDER_NAME>$@
```
{{< /editCode >}}

#### Edit the family configuration provider revision activation policy

Change the family configuration provider's `revisionActivationPolicy` from `Manual` to `Automatic`.

```shell
sed 's/revisionActivationPolicy: Manual/revisionActivationPolicy: Automatic/' sp-family-manual.yaml > sp-family-automatic.yaml
```

Apply the updated family configuration provider manifest.

```shell
kubectl apply -f sp-family-automatic.yaml
```

#### Edit the family resource providers revision activation policies

Change the family resource providers' `revisionActivationPolicy` from `Manual` to `Automatic`.

```shell
sed 's/revisionActivationPolicy: Manual/revisionActivationPolicy: Automatic/' sp-manual.yaml > sp-automatic.yaml
```

Apply the updated family resource provider manifests.

```shell
kubectl apply -f sp-automatic.yaml
```

#### Verify the provider and resources

View the status of the updated family providers.
```bash {copy-lines="1"}
kubectl get managed
NAME                                                   READY   SYNCED   EXTERNAL-NAME                 AGE

upbound-provider-family-aws   True        True      xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-family-aws:v0.36.0   3m44s
```

#### Restore the resource deletion policy

Restore the resource deletion policy to `Delete`.

{{< hint "warning" >}}
This updates the deletion policy of **all** resources. If you expect any
resources to
use the `Orphan` policy, update those individually or manually change
the policy to `Delete` on the other resources.
{{< /hint >}}

```shell
kubectl patch $(kubectl get managed -o name) -p '{"spec":{"deletionPolicy":"Delete"}}' --type=merge
```

The cluster is now fully migrated to a family provider.

### Automated migration

`family-migrator` is a tool to automate the migration process from the
monolithic to provider family architecture. The tool supports an interactive and
non-interactive migration path.

#### Pre-requisites

- `kubectl`: Before starting the execution phase, please ensure you have the
`kubectl` tool installed. `family-migrator` uses the `kubectl` tool in the
execution phase, and it assumes availability of this tool locally during the
non-interactive run.
<!-- vale Upbound.Spelling = NO -->
<!-- vale gitlab.SubstitutionWarning = NO -->
<!-- ignore "kubeconfig" -->
- The user must be on a device with access to the Kubernetes cluster. If the
default config file (`~/.kube/config`) doesn't refer to the cluster to migrate,
the user must set the `--kubeconfig` flag with the path to the config file that
references the correct cluster.
<!-- vale Upbound.Spelling = YES -->
<!-- vale gitlab.SubstitutionWarning = YES -->
- The `family-migrator` tool currently supports a limited scenario. The scenario
assumes the following:
  - The cluster contains an installed configuration package. In other
  words, the cluster has a `Configuration.pkg.crossplane.io/v1` resource
  and one or more monolithic provider.
  - The configuration package and its examples are available on the user's local
  file system
    - Configuration package: This directory contains the
    Configuration.meta.pkg.crossplane.io manifest (that contains the provider
    dependencies), Compositions, and CompositeResourceDefinitions. An example,
    configuration package:
    <https://github.com/upbound/platform-ref-gcp/tree/main/package>.
    - Examples: This directory may contain Claims, and
    Configuration.pkg.crossplane.io resource. An example of configuration
    examples: <https://github.com/upbound/platform-ref-gcp/tree/main/examples>.
  - To user has the required authorization to push the new configuration package
  image to the registry

#### Installation

1. Please use the [Releases] page to download the `family-migrator` tool. Download
the appropriate binary for your operating system (`Linux` or `Darwin/macOS`) and
architecture (`amd64` or `arm64`). The download is an executable file
which might require the necessary file permissions to allow execution.
1. Move the downloaded binary to `/usr/local/bin`
1. Give permission to execute the binary

  ```shell
  chmod +x family-migrator_darwin-arm64
  ```

{{<hint "note" >}}
In Darwin/macOS, the following error can be shown while trying to run the
executable. Please allow this application in the Security Settings by using the
`Allow Anyway`.
{{<img src="providers/images/malicious-software.jpeg" alt="Malicious Software Error" size="tiny">}}
{{<img src="providers/images/allow-anyway.jpeg" alt="Allow Anyway" size="small">}}
{{< /hint >}}

#### Usage

The `family-migrator` tool has two sub-commands, `generate` and `execute`.

The help output of the `family-migrator`:

{{<img src="providers/images/family-migrator-help.jpeg" alt="family-migrator help output" size="medium">}}

- `generate`: This command generates the migration plan. After the tool creates
the migration plan, it confirms if execution of the created plan should proceed.

- `execute`: Used for executing a generated migration plan. You must generate a
migration plan first before running this command.

The `family-migrator` tool needs several inputs for generating and executing the
plan. It prompts for all required options when executing the command.

#### Required inputs

When running the `family-migrator generate` command, the tool prompts the
user with a series of questions to gather the required inputs:

<!-- vale Google.Will = NO -->
<!-- vale gitlab.FutureTense = NO -->
<!-- vale write-good.Passive = NO -->
{{< table "table table-sm table-striped">}}
| Required input | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Please specify the path for the migration plan** | The answer represents the output path of the migration plan. Users need to provide a path for generating the plan and patch files. For example, `/tmp/generated/migration-plan.yaml` |
| **Please provide the registry and organization for the provider family packages** | The format must be `<registry host>/<organization>`, for example, `xpkg.upbound.io/upbound`. |
| **Please select the providers that will be migrated** | The tool presents user with a list of the monolithic providers they can select to migrate from. The tool supports multiple selections. |
| **Please specify the version of the provider-abc family** | Provide the versions of the family provider to migrate to for each selected provider. If you want to migrate to the latest version, refer to the [Upbound Marketplace]. The version format must be `v0.y.y` |
| **Please enter the URL of the migration source Configuration package** | Provide the registry URL of the currently installed Configuration Package. The value appears in the `spec.package` path of `Configuration.pkg.crossplane.io/v1` resource. For example, `xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/platform-ref-gcp:v0.3.0` |
| **Please enter the URL of the migration target Configuration package** | The tool builds a new configuration package during migration. Specify the registry URL where the migrated built package is uploaded. For example, `<registry-host>/<organization>/platform-ref-gcp:v0.3.0-migrated` |
| **Please specify the source directory for the Crossplane Configuration package** | Specify the source directory to the location of the configuration package.

After the tool collects all the inputs it needs, it generates and exports the
migration plan to the specified path. It then asks whether to continue to
execute the created plan.

{{<hint "note" >}}
Generating the plan may take some time, depending on the number of providers and
CRDs in your cluster. Please do not stop the process until it completes. After
generation, the tool shows a message that the plan has been generated.

#### Review generated plan, manifests, and patch files

After moving on to the execution phase, confirm the review of the generated
plan and manifests. After confirmation, you have the
option to list the execution instructions.

{{<hint "note" >}}
The purpose of this intermediary step is to allow for manual verification to ensure
no unexpected steps are introduced in the plan. While the review process is optional
and does not directly affect the transition to the execution phase, it is strongly
recommended to complete the review process.

#### Execution

Having collected the required inputs, generated the migration plan, and reviewed the plan,
the execution phase can now proceed.

The tool has two modes for execution:

`Do you want to execute the migration plan with step-by-step confirmation or
no interaction`

- **Step-by-Step (Interactive):** In this option, the tool executes each step
individually, providing context and asking for confirmation.
- **No Interaction:** In this option, the tool executes all steps without any
interaction.

##### Step-by-Step (interactive) execution

With the interactive execution mode, for each step, there are three options:

```bash
? Step (with name "backup-managed-resources" at index 0) to execute:
sh -c "kubectl get managed -o yaml > backup/managed-resources.yaml"
What is your execution preference?
```

- **Automatically**: The step gets executed and the output shown.
- **Manually**: The step needs to be manually executed by the user.
- **Skip**: No execution takes place. Be careful since you can't return
to a skipped step.

{{<hint "note" >}}
Steps to backup the resources may take a long time, depending on the number of
resources, installed providers, and CRDs in the cluster.
{{< /hint >}}

##### Non-Interactive execution

In this mode execution of the migration plan proceeds without user interaction.

You can verify the correct completion of the migration by checking
the status of the cluster. Use the following commands to confirm the cluster
status:

- `kubectl get providers.pkg.crossplane.io`: The family
providers should show instead of monolithic ones.
- `kubectl get pods -n upbound-system`: The family
provider pods should show in the `upbound-system` namespace.
- `kubectl get configurations.pkg.crossplane.io`: The newly built configuration
package appears in the `spec.package` path. The family provider references
appear in the `spec.dependsOn` path of Configuration.meta.pkg.crossplane.io
(by default `crossplane.yaml`) manifest. This manifest is in the source package
directory on the file system.

## Upgrading to a Official Provider version with breaking API changes

Documentation coming soon.

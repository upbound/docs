Claims are higher-level abstractions that your users can use for self-service
resource deployment. Claims have a simplified structure with fewer required
fields and less configuration since many of the default values and rules are
already defined in the XRD and Composition.

Claims allow you to:

* give your users a self-service method for resource management while adhering
  to your organizational policies
* automatically provision resources with the control plane workflow
* maintain governance and consistency across your managed resources

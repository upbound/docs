Identity in Upbound is composed of four core pieces:

- [Users]({{<ref "/users/users" >}})
- [Teams]({{<ref "/users/teams" >}})
- [Organizations]({{<ref "/users/organizations" >}})
- [Robots]({{<ref "/users/robots" >}})

Some features of Upbound, like [publishing packages]({{<ref "upbound-marketplace/packages" >}}), are only available to registered Upbound users.

Register and manage Upbound accounts at [accounts.upbound.io](https://accounts.upbound.io)

              E2ETestSpec defines the specification for e2e testing of Crossplane
              configurations. It orchestrates the complete test lifecycle including setting
              up controlplane, applying test resources in the correct order (InitResources
              → Configuration → ExtraResources → Manifests), validating conditions, and
              handling cleanup. This spec allows you to define e2e tests that verify your
              Crossplane compositions, providers, and managed resources work correctly
              together in a real controlplane environment.

                  Crossplane specifies the Crossplane configuration and settings required
                  for this test. This includes the version of Universal Crossplane to
                  install, and optional auto-upgrade settings. The configuration defined
                  here will be used to set up the controlplane before applying the test
                  manifests.

                          default:
                          - None: disables auto-upgrades and keeps the control plane at its current version of Crossplane.
                          - Patch: automatically upgrades the control plane to the latest supported patch version when it
                            becomes available while keeping the minor version the same.
                          - Stable: automatically upgrades the control plane to the latest supported patch release on minor
                            version N-1, where N is the latest supported minor version.
                          - Rapid: automatically upgrades the cluster to the latest supported patch release on the latest
                            supported minor version.

                  the resources are functioning correctly. Each condition is a string

                  ExtraResources specifies additional Kubernetes resources that should be
                  created or updated after the configuration has been successfully applied.
                  These resources may depend on the primary configuration being in place.
                  Common use cases include ConfigMaps, Secrets, providerConfigs. Each
                  resource must be a valid Kubernetes object.

                  InitResources specifies Kubernetes resources that must be created or
                  updated before the configuration is applied. These are typically
                  prerequisite resources that the configuration depends on. Common use
                  cases include ImageConfigs, DeploymentRuntimeConfigs, or any foundational
                  resources required for the configuration to work. Each resource must be a
                  valid Kubernetes object.

                  Manifests contains the Kubernetes resources that will be applied as part
                  of this e2e test. These are the primary resources being tested - they
                  will be created in the controlplane and then validated against the
                  conditions specified in DefaultConditions. Each manifest must be a valid
                  Kubernetes object. At least one manifest is required. Examples include
                  Claims, Composite Resources or any Kubernetes resource you want to test.

              timeoutSeconds:
                description: |-
                  TimeoutSeconds defines the maximum duration in seconds that the test is
                  allowed to run before being marked as failed. This includes time for
                  resource creation, condition checks, and any reconciliation processes. If
                  not specified, a default timeout will be used. Consider setting higher
                  values for tests involving complex resources or those requiring multiple
                  reconciliation cycles.

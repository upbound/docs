Create or update an existing billing report by merging data from a local billing report tarball.

This command takes a billing report produced by 'up space billing export'
and adds its data to a target billing report.
An existing target report is updated in place.
If the target report doesn't exist, it will be created using the data from the
source tarball.

The target report can be stored on the local file system or in cloud storage.

Credentials and other storage provider configuration are supplied according to
the instructions for each provider below.

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

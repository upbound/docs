Migrate control planes to Upbound Managed Control Planes.

The `migration` command seamlessly migrates control plane resources from
Crossplane or Upbound Crossplane (UXP) environments to Managed Control Planes in
Upbound Spaces.

This command simplifies the process of transferring your existing Crossplane
configurations and states into the Upbound platform, ensuring a smooth
transition with minimal downtime.

For detailed information on each command and its options, use the `--help` flag
with the specific command (e.g., `up controlplane migration export --help`).


#### Usage

`up controlplane migration <command> [flags]`

This page describes how to view and manage Upbound repositories.

## Viewing repositories

To view a list of repositories:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="up" label="up">

    1. Run the following command to list repositories:

    ```shell
    up repository list
    ```
 
 </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Console" label="Console">
    Open the Repositories page in the Upbound Console. This page is available at `console.upbound.io/<org-name>/repositories`.

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Update repository settings

Repositories have either `public` or `private` visibility:

* `public` visibility means that any published versions of your package have a public listing page in the Marketplace and authorized credentials aren't required to pull.
* `private` visibility means that any published versions of your package have a listing page that only you and other collaborators in your organization can see. Packages require authorized credentials to pulled.

Once created, you can't change these repository settings.

<CodeBlock cloud="aws">

A Dedicated Space deployed on AWS is a single-tenant deployment of a control plane space in your AWS organization in an isolated sub-account. With Dedicated Spaces, you can use the same API, CLI, and Console that Upbound offers, with the benefit of running entirely in a cloud account that you own and Upbound manages for you.

The following guide walks you through setting up a Dedicated Space in your AWS organization. If you have any questions while working through this guide, contact your Upbound Account Representative for help.

## Dedicated Space on AWS architecture

A Dedicated Space is a deployment of the Upbound Spaces software inside an Upbound-controlled sub-account in your AWS cloud environment. The Spaces software runs in this sub-account, orchestrated by Kubernetes. Backups and billing data get stored inside bucket or blob storage in the same sub-account. The control planes deployed and controlled by the Spaces software runs on the Kubernetes cluster which gets deployed into the sub-account.

The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture of Upbound Dedicated Spaces:
<!--- TODO(tr0njavolta): image --->

The Spaces software gets deployed on an EKS Cluster in the region of your choice. This EKS cluster is where your control planes are ultimately run. Upbound also deploys buckets, 1 for the collection of the billing data and 1 for control plane backups.

Upbound doesn't have access to other sub-accounts nor your organization-level settings in your cloud environment. Outside of your cloud organization, Upbound runs the Upbound Console, which includes the Upbound API and web application, including the dashboard you see at `console.upbound.io`. By default, all connections are encrypted, but public. Optionally, you also have the option to use private network connectivity through [AWS PrivateLink][aws-privatelink].

## Prerequisites

- An organization created on Upbound
- You should have a preexisting AWS organization to complete this guide. 
- You must create a new AWS sub-account. Read the [AWS documentation][aws-documentation] to learn how to create a new sub-account in an existing organization on AWS.

After the sub-account information gets provided to Upbound, **don't change it any further.** Any changes made to the sub-account or the resources created by Upbound for the purposes of the Dedicated Space deployments voids the SLA you have with Upbound. If you want to make configuration changes, contact your Upbound Solutions Architect.

## Set up cross-account management

Upbound supports using AWS Key Management Service with cross-account IAM permissions. This enables the isolation of keys so the infrastructure operated by Upbound has limited access to symmetric keys.

In the KMS key's account, apply the baseline key policy:

```json
{
  "Sid": "Allow Upbound to use this key",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": ["[Dedicated Space sub-account ID]"]
  },
  "Action": ["kms:Encrypt", "kms:Decrypt", "kms:ReEncrypt*", "kms:GenerateDataKey*", "kms:DescribeKey"],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

You need another key policy to let the sub-account create persistent resources with the KMS key:

```json
{
  "Sid": "Allow attachment of persistent resources for an Upbound Dedicated Space",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "[Dedicated Space sub-account ID]"
  },
  "Action": ["kms:CreateGrant", "kms:ListGrants", "kms:RevokeGrant"],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure PrivateLink

By default, all connections to the Upbound Console are encrypted, but public. AWS PrivateLink is a feature that allows VPC peering whereby your traffic doesn't traverse the public internet. To have this configured, contact your Upbound Account Representative.

## Provide information to Upbound

Once these policies get attached to the key, tell your Upbound Account Representative, providing them the following:

- the full ARN of the KMS key. 
- the name of the organization that you created in Upbound. Use the up CLI command, `up org list`, so see this information.
- Confirmation of which region in AWS you want the deployment to target.

Once Upbound has this information, the request gets processed in a business day. 

## Use your Dedicated Space

Once the Dedicated Space gets deployed, you can see it in the Space selector when browsing your environment on [`console.upbound.io`][console-upbound-io].

<CodeBlock cloud="gcp">

A Dedicated Space deployed on GCP is a single-tenant deployment of a control plane space in your GCP organization in an isolated project. With Dedicated Spaces, you can use the same API, CLI, and Console that Upbound offers, with the benefit of running entirely in a cloud account that you own and Upbound manages for you.

The following guide walks you through setting up a Dedicated Space in your GCP organization. If you have any questions while working through this guide, contact your Upbound Account Representative for help.

## Dedicated Space on GCP architecture

A Dedicated Space is a deployment of the Upbound Spaces software inside an Upbound-controlled project in your GCP cloud environment. The Spaces software runs in this project, orchestrated by Kubernetes. Backups and billing data get stored inside bucket or blob storage in the same project. The control planes deployed and controlled by the Spaces software runs on the Kubernetes cluster which gets deployed into the project.

The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture of Upbound Dedicated Spaces:
<!--- TODO(tr0njavolta): image --->
![Upbound Dedicated Spaces arch](/img/managed-arch-gcp.png)

The Spaces software gets deployed on a GKE Cluster in the region of your choice. This GKE cluster is where your control planes are ultimately run. Upbound also deploys cloud buckets, 1 for the collection of the billing data and 1 for control plane backups.

Upbound doesn't have access to other projects nor your organization-level settings in your cloud environment. Outside of your cloud organization, Upbound runs the Upbound Console, which includes the Upbound API and web application, including the dashboard you see at `console.upbound.io`. By default, all connections are encrypted, but public. Optionally, you also have the option to use private network connectivity through [GCP Private Service Connect][gcp-private-service-connect].

## Prerequisites

- An organization created on Upbound
- You should have a preexisting GCP organization with an active Cloud Billing account to complete this guide. 
- You must create a new GCP project. Read the [GCP documentation][gcp-documentation] to learn how to create a new project in an existing organization on GCP.

After the project information gets provided to Upbound, **don't change it any further.** Any changes made to the project or the resources created by Upbound for the purposes of the Dedicated Space deployments voids the SLA you have with Upbound. If you want to make configuration changes, contact your Upbound Solutions Architect.

## Enable APIs

Enable the following APIs in the new project:

- Kubernetes Engine API
- Cloud Resource Manager API
- Compute Engine API
- Cloud DNS API

:::tip
Read how to enable APIs in a GCP project [here][here].
:::

## Create a service account

Create a service account in the new project. Name the service account, upbound-sa. Give the service account the following roles:

- Compute Admin
- Project IAM Admin
- Service Account Admin
- DNS Administrator
- Editor

Select the service account you just created. Select keys. Add a new key and select JSON. The key gets downloaded to your machine. Save this for later. 

## Create a DNS Zone

Create a DNS Zone, set the **Zone type** to `Public`.

### Configure Private Service Connect

By default, all connections to the Upbound Console are encrypted, but public. GCP Private Service Connect is a feature that allows VPC peering whereby your traffic doesn't traverse the public internet. To have this configured, contact your Upbound Account Representative.

## Provide information to Upbound

Once these policies get attached to the key, tell your Upbound Account Representative, providing them the following:

- The service account JSON key
- The NS records associated with the DNS name created in the last step.
- the name of the organization that you created in Upbound. Use the up CLI command, `up org list`, so see this information.
- Confirmation of which region in GCP you want the deployment to target.

Once Upbound has this information, the request gets processed in a business day. 

## Use your Dedicated Space

Once the Dedicated Space gets deployed, you can see it in the Space selector when browsing your environment on [`console.upbound.io`][console-upbound-io].

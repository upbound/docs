Upbound allows organizations to segregate repository access to consume only
authorized artifacts like configuration packages,
[providers][crossplane-providers], functions and add-ons. SBOM, CVE, and other
relevant checks must pass to use these artifacts.

Controlled repository access uses `ImageConfig` to limit production control
planes from consuming unauthorized repositories and unsigned images.

## Example `ImageConfig`

The `ImageConfig` below is an example of a production control plane with
`Verification` restrictions:
```
kubectl describe imageconfigs.pkg.crossplane.io
```

```
Name:         verify-upbound-images
Namespace:
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1
Kind:         ImageConfig

        Name:         Verify Images
    Provider:         Cosign
Events:               <none>
```

If you try to install any unsigned Upbound packages, pods to not start, the
image doesn't pull, and the control plane marks the revision as unhealthy.

```
kubectl get pkgrev
```

```
NAME                                                                       HEALTHY   RUNTIME   IMAGE                                             STATE    AGE

```

If you describe the revision, the status condition returns with signature
verification failure as expected.

## Image signing


For more information about image signing, review the [sigstore-cosign]
repository.

## Benefits

Adding image verification provides the following benefits:

- Allows developers to push artifacts to multiple [marketplace] registries,
    including third-party enterprise locations. Production control planes only
    consume signed image versions
- Signs images that pass CI/CD pipeline tests automatically
- Use images between development and production repositories without moving
    them.
- Requires less complexity in team permissions, robot account and token
    management
- Allows any authorized consumer to pull signed images

:::warning
You **must** install the `ImageConfig` after creating a production control
plane.

## Data transfers

Upbound documents reasons for the transfer of data out of your organization's

## Data residency and Upbound Marketplace


The Upbound Marketplace, including the `marketplace.upbound.io` web portal and
the OCI registry `xpkg.upbound.io`, is served from the United States.

To pull images hosted in the Marketplace from within an EU data boundary, Upbound
recommends mirroring these images to your own OCI registry.

[Upbound Marketplace][upbound-marketplace] simplifies your control plane journey
with the largest registry for storing, managing, and sharing control plane
extensions. It integrates seamlessly with Upbound's control plane project
tooling. It also provides platform engineers with pre-built Configurations and
Functions to speed up control plane development workflows.

The Upbound Marketplace is the main source for publicly available Crossplane packages.

## Extensions in the Marketplace

The Marketplace supports the following control plane extensions:
<!-- vale write-good.TooWordy = NO -->
- [Crossplane providers][crossplane-providers] are packages that enable Upbound control planes to interact with external APIs.
- [Configurations][control-plane-configurations] are packages that define one or more resource types, called Composite Resources.
- [Functions][composition-functions] are packages that define reusable logic, either for use in a composition or operation pipeline.
- [Add-Ons][add-ons] are packages that extend Upbound control planes with additional capabilities.
<!-- vale write-good.TooWordy = YES -->

# Overview

Crossplane supports these package types: `Configurations`, `Functions` and `Providers`. Upbound Crossplane (UXP) extends this with support for `Add-Ons`.

* **`Add-On`** packages are Upbound Crossplane-only packages that extend your control plane capabilities.
* **`Configuration`** packages combine Crossplane _Composite Resource Definitions_, _Compositions_ and metadata.
* **`Function`** packages include the compiled function code for single or
  multiple processor architectures.
* **`Provider`** packages combine a [Kubernetes controller][kubernetes-controller] container, associated _Custom Resource Definitions_ (`CRDs`) and metadata. The Crossplane open source [AWS provider package][aws-provider-package] is an example a provider's metadata and `CRDs`.

For information on package access, availability, support policies, and licensing, see the [Package Policies][package-policy] documentation.

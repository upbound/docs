Upbound Official Providers are Crossplane providers built as OCI images and published into the [Upbound Marketplace][upbound-marketplace]. Upbound publishes, maintains, and supports these listings.

## Introduction

Official Providers are commercially licensed builds of Crossplane providers. These providers may be closed source, or they may be downstream from open source (such as the case for [provider-family-aws][provider-family-aws]).

Upbound publishes and maintains Official Providers. Some enterprise-grade advantages of Official Providers are:

* Multi-language resource schemas for [KCL][kcl], [Python][python], [Go][go], and [Go Templating][gotemplating] to improve the Crossplane composition authoring experience.
* Backporting of fixes supported during 12 months of mainstream support + 6 months additional access
* An SBOM
* [Signed by Upbound][signed-by-upbound]
* Commercial support available from Upbound

Upbound's Official Providers integrate with the Upbound platform to provide the best provider experience. You need an [account on Upbound][account-on-upbound] to [pull an Official Provider][pull-an-official-provider].

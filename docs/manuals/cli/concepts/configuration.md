description: Configuration for the Upbound CLI

This document explains the basics of profile configurations and how they work in
the Upbound CLI (`up`). Profile configurations enable you to manage multiple
environments and authentication contexts efficiently.

A **profile configuration** is a stored set of connection and authentication
information that the `up` CLI uses to interact with different Upbound systems.
`up` stores this information in a configuration file at `~/.up/config.json`,
allowing you to switch between different environments, organizations, and
authentication contexts without re-entering credentials each time.

The `up` CLI uses the specified profile when set via the `--profile` flag or
`UP_PROFILE` environment variable. If you don't specify a profile, `up` uses the
currently selected profile in the configuration file.

## Profile types

Profiles have one of two types, each designed for different deployment scenarios:

- **Cloud profiles**: Interact with Upbound Cloud and Connected Spaces within a given Upbound organization. These profiles are designed for users working with Upbound's managed service.

- **Disconnected profiles**: Interact with specific self-hosted Spaces not connected to Upbound Cloud. These profiles enable you to manage on-premises or private cloud deployments.

Both profile types can authenticate with an Upbound organization to manage
non-Space resources like Marketplace repositories. Authentication with a
disconnected profile is optional, providing flexibility for air-gapped or highly
secure environments.

## Background

Profile types were introduced in `up` v0.37.0 to support the growing variety of
deployment patterns in the Upbound ecosystem. All profiles created in previous
versions are automatically treated as cloud profiles in newer versions, ensuring
backward compatibility.

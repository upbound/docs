The Simulations feature is in private preview. For more information, [reach out to Upbound][reach-out-to-upbound].
:::

Simulations are temporary copies of an existing control plane that allow you 
preview the impact of changes before applying these changes to your environment.

This feature is valuable for organizations transitioning from
traditional IaC tools like Terraform, where previewing changes with `terraform
plan` is a standard practice. Your control plane simulation allows Crossplane to
run a composition controller and inspect how the controller behaves with
proposed changes.

Simulations provide visibility for your resource changes, including:

* New resources to create
* Existing resources to change
* Existing resources to delete
* How configuration changes propagate through the system

This can help you reduce the risk of unexpected behavior based on your changes.

This guide provides instructions for using the `up ctp simulate` command and the
[Simulation API][simulation-api] to test changes in your control plane.

## Prerequisites

* The Upbound CLI installed
* An Upbound account with the Simulations feature enabled
* kubectl installed

## Deploy a base control plane

This example uses a control plane that runs a `nop` provider to illustrate how
the simulations feature works.

Clone the example repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/upbound/no-op-sim.git && cd no-op-sim
```

Login to your Upbound account in the CLI:

```ini
up login --account=<your_upbound_account>
```

Run the project in a control plane:

```shell
up project run
```

Set your context to the control plane you just created:

```shell
up ctx ./noop
```

Deploy the example XR to create your initial resources:

```shell
kubectl apply -f examples/noop/example-xr.yaml
```

## Run a simulation

First, change your control plane context to the group level of the running
control plane. For example, if your context is your running control plane, use
the `up ctx` command to switch to the group level.

```shell
up ctx ..
```

<!-- vale Upbound.Spelling = NO -->
Next, make a change in the `examples/noop/example-xr.yaml` file in the project.
In this example, comment out the first `ultimateAnswer` and uncomment the
correct value assignment.
<!-- vale Upbound.Spelling = YES -->

```yaml {hl_lines="11-12"}
apiVersion: customer.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: XNoOp
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
spec:
  compositionRef:
    name: noops.customer.upbound.io
  parameters:
    ultimateQuestion: "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
    #ultimateAnswer: 41
    ultimateAnswer: 42

```


Save this change and run your simulation. The `up ctp simulate` command creates
a simulation of the base control plane and applies the changes found in your
changed resource directory into the mock control plane.

```shell
 up alpha ctp simulate noop  --changeset=./examples/noop/example-xr.yaml --complete-after=60s --terminate-on-finish
```

Your command line returns a summary of the resources created, modified, or
deleted for each resource affected:

```ini {copy-lines="none"}
Simulation "noop-6wqg9" created
▄  [1/5]: Waiting for simulated control plane to start (30s)
▄  [2/5]: Waiting for simulated control plane to start (30s)
✓  [3/5]: Waiting for simulation to complete
▀  [4/5]: Computing simulated differences (0s)

✓  [4/5]: Computing simulated differences
▀  [5/5]: Terminating simulation (0s)

 ✓  [5/5]: Terminating simulation

## Simulations API

When you create a simulation in Upbound, you interact with the Spaces API
`simulations` endpoint. The Simulations endpoint has three key fields:

* `spec.controlPlaneName`
* `spec.completionCriteria`
* `spec.desiredState`

### `controlPlaneName`

The `controlPlaneName` field specifies the base control plane. You must specify
the control plane name to create the correct simulation.

### `completionCriteria`

The `completionCriteria` field specifies how Spaces should
determine when the simulation is complete. When the simulation meets the
criteria you set, Upbound sets the simulated control plane's desired state to
`Complete`.

The `completionCriteria` is list of criteria that determines when a simulation
should complete. We currently only support `type: Duration`, a string that
indicates the duration of how long a simulation should run for in seconds.

```yaml {copy-lines="none", hl_lines="9-11"}
apiVersion: spaces.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Simulation
metadata:
  name: simulation
  namespace: default
spec:
  controlPlaneName: source
  desiredState: AcceptingChanges
  completionCriteria:
  - type: Duration
    duration: 90s
```

When you start a simulation, you can add the `complete-after` flag to explicitly
define the `completionCriteria` of your simulation:

```shell
up alpha ctp simulate noop --changeset=./examples/noop/example-xr.yaml --complete-after=30s --terminate-on-finish
```

The recommended minimum `completionCriteria` time is 60 seconds. To remove the
completion criteria, pass an empty string flag and manually mark the simulation
complete:

```shell
up alpha ctp simulate noop --changeset=./examples/noop/example-xr.yaml --complete-after=""
```

### `desiredState`

The `desiredState` field specifies the current state of the simulation. The
simulation control plane status defaults to `acceptingChanges` until the
simulation meets the `completionCriteria` or you end the simulation.

To manually end a simulation, use `kubectl` to set the `desiredState`. A
simulation marked `complete` populates the result status and continues running.
A `terminated` simulation deletes the simulated control plane.

### Use the simulations API

You can create a simulation using the API:


```yaml 
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
 apiVersion: spaces.upbound.io/v1alpha1
 kind: Simulation
 metadata:
   name: my-simulation
   namespace: default
 spec:
   controlPlaneName: noop 
   desiredState: AcceptingChanges
   completionCriteria:
   - type: Duration
     duration: 120s
 EOF
```

Once you create the simulation object, Upbound populates the `status` field with
information about the simulation including:

* Created, modified, deleted resources
* The state of the simulation (Running, Completed, Terminated)
* Start and/or completion time

## View simulation results in the Upbound Console

You can also view your simulation results in the Upbound Console:

1. Navigate to your base control plane in the Upbound Console
2. Select the "Simulations" tab in the menu
3. Select a simulation object for a change list of all resources affected.

The Console provides visual indications of changes:

- Created Resources: Marked with green Modified Resources: Marked with yellow
- Deleted Resources: Marked with red Unchanged Resources: Displayed in gray

## Managing your simulations

To view all simulations for a specific control plane, you can run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get simulations
```

The output returns all simulations associated with your control plane:

```shell {copy-lines="none"}
NAME         SOURCE   SIMULATED          ACCEPTING-CHANGES   STATE                  AGE
noop-6wqg9   noop     noop-sim-1dcf6ed   False               SimulationTerminated   28m
```

To destroy your simulated control planes, you can manually delete them with
`kubectl`.

```yaml
kubectl delete simulations <your_simulation_control_plane>
```

## Considerations 

Simulations is a **private preview** feature. 

Be aware of the following limitations:

- Simulations can't predict the exact behavior of external systems due to the
    complexity and non-deterministic reconciliation pattern in Crossplane.

- The only completion criteria for a simulation is time. Your simulation may not
    receive a conclusive result within that interval. Upbound recommends the
    default `60s` value.

- Providers don't run in simulations. Simulations can't compose resources that
    rely on the status of Managed Resources.


The Upbound team is working to improve this feature. Your feedback is always appreciated.

# Overview

Upbound Crossplane (UXP) is the AI-native distribution of Crossplane
by Upbound. Crossplane is a framework for building your own control plane.

Upbound Crossplane is a key ingredient in building out a platform powered by an
intelligent control plane architecture. Learn about how UXP brings AI
intelligence into your control plane's reconcile loop with Intelligent Control
Planes.

## Concepts

Because UXP is distribution of upstream Crossplane, it shares the same concepts
as upstream. UXP also introduces brand new concepts, such as AI-powered
Intelligent Control Planes and Add-Ons.

Learn about UXP concepts by reading the concept documentation.

## Features

Upbound Crossplane comes with features that help you start, run, and
scale your control plane. Learn about the features in UXP by reading the feature
documentation.

UXP is available to any users under Upbound's Community plan. Commercial
licenses are available. Some features are available for Community plan users,
while others require a commercial license. See license management for more
details.

# Overview

Upbound Crossplane (UXP) is the AI-native distribution of [Crossplane][crossplane] by Upbound. Crossplane is a framework for building your own [control plane][control-plane].

:::tip

Upbound Crossplane is a key ingredient in building out a platform powered by an **intelligent control plane architecture.** Learn about how UXP safely brings AI intelligence into your control plane's reconcile loop with [Intelligent Control Planes][intelligent-control-planes].

## Concepts

Because Upbound Crossplane is a distribution of upstream Crossplane, you'll find UXP shares the same concepts as upstream. UXP also introduces brand new concepts, such as AI-powered [Intelligent Control Planes][intelligent-control-planes] and [Add-Ons][add-ons]. 

Learn about UXP concepts by reading the [concept documentation][concepts].

## Features

Upbound Crossplane comes with a number of features that help you start, run, and scale your control plane. Learn about the features in UXP by reading the [feature documentation][features].

UXP is available to any users under Upbound's Community plan. Commercial licenses are available. Some features are available for Community plan users, while others require a commercial license. See [license management][licensing] for more details.

## How-tos 

To learn about Crossplane and UXP features, read the [how-to guides][guides].

## Deploy and run UXP

Upbound runs UXP for you in our control planes-as-a-service Spaces hosting environment. Users can also [deploy][self-managed-uxp] a self-managed installation of UXP directly on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Get Started

Read the [Get Started][get-started] guide to learn how to use UXP to build your own control plane.

# Overview
<!-- vale gitlab.HeadingContent = YES -->

Upbound Crossplane (UXP) is the AI-native distribution of [Crossplane][crossplane] by Upbound. Crossplane is a framework for building your own [control plane][control-plane].

:::tip

Upbound Crossplane is a key ingredient in building out a platform powered by an **intelligent control plane architecture.** Learn about how UXP integrates AI intelligence into your control plane's reconcile loop with [Intelligent Control Planes][intelligent-control-planes].

## Concepts

Upbound Crossplane is a distribution of upstream Crossplane and shares the same concepts. UXP also introduces new concepts, such as AI-powered [Intelligent Control Planes][intelligent-control-planes] and [Add-Ons][add-ons]. 

Learn about UXP concepts by reading the [concept documentation][concepts].

## Features

Upbound Crossplane includes features that help you start, run, and scale your control plane. Learn about UXP features in the [feature documentation][features].

UXP is available to any users under Upbound's Community plan. Commercial licenses are available. Some features are available for Community plan users, while others require a commercial license. See [license management][licensing] for more details.

## Commercial-only features

Users on a **Standard Plan** or greater have access to commercial features that enhance the reliability, efficiency, and supportability of their control planes. For more information, see [pricing plans][pricing] or [contact the sales team][contact-sales].

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| [Backup and Restore][backup-restore] | Automatically schedule control plane snapshots for disaster recovery and seamless upgrades. |
| [Function Scale-to-Zero][function-scale-to-zero] | Reduce resource consumption by automatically scaling composition functions to zero when idle. |
| [Official Package Patch Releases][official-package-support] | Access patch releases of Official Providers with security fixes and bug patches. |
| [Provider Pod Autoscaling][provider-vpa] | Dynamically adjust CPU and memory for provider pods to handle performance spikes. |

## How-tos 

To learn about Crossplane and UXP features, read the [how-to guides][guides].

## Deploy and run UXP

<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->
Upbound runs UXP for you in our control planes-as-a-service Spaces hosting environment. Users can also [deploy][self-managed-uxp] a self-managed installation of UXP directly on a Kubernetes cluster.
<!-- vale Google.We = YES -->

In UXP, embedded functions now support revisioning. This will enable you to create more advanced operation pipelines and flexible rollout strategies.

Function revisions are similar to Composition Revisions – you can now version your embedded functions, and enable rollbacks.
-- ##TODO add example on how to use function revisions
- Currently, only single revisions are active per function. Multiple active revisions are coming as a fast follow.

In addition, autoscaling is now enabled for embedded functions within UXP. Your functions now scale based on usage/load, improving efficiency

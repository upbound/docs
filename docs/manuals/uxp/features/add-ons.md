- Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to deliver more powerful intelligent control in [compositions][intelligent-compositions] and [operations][intelligent-operations].
- Control plane software such as CI/CD tooling like Argo CD and policy engines like Kyverno
- Package and deploy your own Kubernetes custom controllers and manage them with the Package Manager in Upbound Crossplane

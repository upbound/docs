Upbound Crossplane requires a Kubernetes cluster. You can run Upbound Crossplane
in any Kubernetes environment, such as a managed Kubernetes service or in bare-metal environments. Upbound recommends using Helm to install a
self-managed instance of Upbound Crossplane.

## Install Upbound Crossplane

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Helm" label="Helm">


1. Add the `upbound-stable` chart repository:
```bash
helm repo add upbound-stable https://charts.upbound.io/stable && helm repo update
```
2. Install Upbound Crossplane:
```bash
helm install crossplane --namespace crossplane-system --create-namespace upbound-stable/crossplane --devel
```

:::note

Helm requires the use of `--devel` flag for versions with suffixes, like `v2.0.0-up.1`. The Helm repository Upbound uses is the stable repository, so use of that flag is only a workaround. You will always get the latest stable version of Upbound Crossplane.

Make sure you have the up CLI installed and that your current kubeconfig context is pointed at the desired Kubernetes cluster, then run the following command:
```bash
up uxp install
```

## Upgrade from open source Crossplane
:::important
**Version Upgrade Rule**: To meet the [upstream Crossplane
needs](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/discussions/4569#discussioncomment-11836395),
ensure there is **at most one minor version difference for Crossplane versions**
during upgrades.
:::

To upgrade from upstream Crossplane, the target UXP version should match the
Crossplane version until the `-up.N` suffix. You can increment at most one minor
version between Crossplane versions to follow
upstream guidelines.

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Allowed**: Crossplane `v2.0.1` → UXP `v2.0.1-up.N` (same Crossplane version)
- ✅ **Allowed**: Crossplane `v2.0.1` → UXP `v2.1.0-up.N` (one minor version diff in Crossplane)
- ✅ **Allowed**: Crossplane `v2.0.1` → UXP `v2.0.5-up.N` (multiple patch versions allowed)
- ❌ **Not allowed**: Crossplane `v2.0.1` → UXP `v2.2.0-up.N` (two minor version diff in Crossplane)

**Required upgrade path for larger Crossplane version gaps:**

If you want to upgrade from Crossplane `v2.0.1` to UXP `v2.2.1-up.N`, follow this incremental approach to meet
upstream requirements:
1. Crossplane `v2.0.1` → UXP `v2.1.0-up.N`
2. UXP `v2.1.0-up.N` → UXP `v2.2.1-up.N`

description: Configure scheduling of composites to remote control planes
---

Upbound's _Control Plane Topology_ feature lets you build and deploy a platform
of multiple control planes. These control planes work together for a unified platform
experience.


With the _Topology_ feature, you can install resource APIs that are
reconciled by other control planes and configure the routing that occurs between
control planes. You can also build compositions that reference other resources
running on your control plane or elsewhere in Upbound. 

This guide explains how to use Control Plane Topology APIs to install, configure
remote APIs, and build powerful compositions that reference other resources. 

## Benefits

The Control Plane Topology feature provides the following benefits:

* Decouple your platform architecture into independent offerings to improve your platform's software development lifecycle.
* Install composite APIs from Configurations as CRDs which are fulfilled and reconciled by other control planes.
* Route APIs to other control planes by configuring an _Environment_ resource, which define a set of routable dimensions.

## How it works
<!-- vale gitlab.HeadingContent = YES -->

Imagine the scenario where you want to let a user reference a subnet when creating a database instance. To your control plane, the `kind: database` and `kind: subnet` are independent resources. To you as the composition author, these resources have an important relationship. It may be that:

- you don't want your user to ever be able to create a database without specifying a subnet.
- you want to let them create a subnet when they create the database, if it doesn't exist.
- you want to allow them to reuse a subnet that got created elsewhere or gets shared by another user.

In each of these scenarios, you must resort to writing complex composition logic
to handle each case. The problem is compounded when the resource exists in a
context separate from the current control plane's context. Imagine a scenario
where one control plane manages Database resources and a second control plane
manages networking resources. With the _Topology_ feature, you can offload these
concerns to Upbound machinery.

## Compose resources with _ReferencedObjects_
<!-- vale Google.Headings = YES --> 
<!-- vale Microsoft.Headings = YES --> 

_ReferencedObject_ is a resource type available in an Upbound control plane that lets you reference other Kubernetes resources in Upbound.  

:::tip
This feature is useful for composing resources that exist in a
remote context, like another control plane. You can also use
_ReferencedObjects_ to resolve references to any other Kubernetes object
in the current control plane context. This could be a secret, another Crossplane
resource, or more. 
:::

### Declare the resource reference in your XRD

To compose a _ReferencedObject_, you should start by adding a resource reference
in your Composite Resource Definition (XRD). The convention for the resource
reference follows the shape shown below: 

```yaml
<resource>Ref:
  type: object
  properties:
    apiVersion:
      type: string
      default: "<apiVersion-of-resource>"
      enum: [ "<apiVersion-of-resource>" ]
    kind:
      type: string
      default: "<resource-ref-kind>"
      enum: [ "<resource-ref-kind>" ]
    grants:
      type: array
      default: [ "Observe" ]
      items:
        type: string
        enum: [ "Observe", "Create", "Update", "Delete", "*" ]
    name:
      type: string
    namespace:
      type: string
  required:
  - name
```

The `<resource>Ref` should be the kind of resource you want to reference. The `apiVersion` and `kind` should be the associated API version and kind of the resource you want to reference.

The `name` and `namespace` strings are inputs that let your users specify the resource instance.

#### Grants

The `grants` field is a special array that lets you give users the power to influence the behavior of the referenced resource. You can configure which of the available grants you let your user select and which it defaults to. Similar in behavior as [Crossplane management policies][crossplane-management-policies], each grant value does the following:

- **Observe:** The composite may observe the state of the referenced resource.
- **Create:** The composite may create the referenced resource if it doesn't exist.
- **Update:** The composite may update the referenced resource.
- **Delete:** The composite may delete the referenced resource.
- **\*:** The composite has full control over the referenced resource.

Here are some examples that show how it looks in practice:

                type: string

            - name
```
</details>

### Manually add the jsonPath

:::important
This step is a known limitation of the preview. We're working on tooling that
removes the need for authors to do this step.
:::

During the preview timeframe of this feature, you must add an annotation by hand
to the XRD. In your XRD's `metadata.annotations`, set the
`references.upbound.io/schema` annotation. It should be a JSON string in the
following format:

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "references.upbound.io/v1alpha1",
    "kind": "ReferenceSchema",
    "references": [
        {
            "jsonPath": ".spec.parameters.secretRef",
            "kinds": [
                {
                    "apiVersion": "v1",
                    "kind": "Secret"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Flatten this JSON into a string and set the annotation on your XRD. View the
example below for an illustration:

<details>
<summary>Show example setting the references.upbound.io/schema annotation</summary>
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: xthings.networking.acme.com
  annotations:
    references.upbound.io/schema: '{"apiVersion":"references.upbound.io/v1alpha1","kind":"ReferenceSchema","references":[{"jsonPath":".spec.secretRef","kinds":[{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Secret"}]},{"jsonPath":".spec.configMapRef","kinds":[{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"ConfigMap"}]}]}'
```
</details>

  annotations:
    references.upbound.io/schema: '{"apiVersion":"references.upbound.io/v1alpha1","kind":"ReferenceSchema","references":[{"jsonPath":".spec.parameters.secretRef","kinds":[{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Secret"}]},{"jsonPath":".spec.parameters.configMapRef","kinds":[{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"ConfigMap"}]}]}'
```
</details>

You can use a VSCode extension like [vscode-pretty-json][vscode-pretty-json] to make this task easier.
<!-- vale gitlab.Substitutions = YES --> 

### Compose a _ReferencedObject_

To pair with the resource reference declared in your XRD, you must compose the referenced resource. Use the _ReferencedObject_ resource type to bring the resource into your composition. _ReferencedObject_ has the following schema:

```yaml
apiVersion: references.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: ReferencedObject
spec:
  managementPolicies:
  - Observe
  deletionPolicy: Orphan
  composite:
    apiVersion: <composite-apiVersion>
    kind: <composite-kind>
    name: <composite-instance-name>
    jsonPath: .spec.parameters.secretRef
```

The `spec.composite.apiVersion` and `spec.composite.kind` should match the API version and kind of the `compositeTypeRef` declared in your composition. The `spec.composite.name` should be the name of the composite resource instance. 

The `spec.composite.jsonPath` should be the path to the root of the resource ref you declared in your XRD.

<details>
<summary>Show example for composing a resource reference to a secret</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Composition
metadata:
  name: demo-composition
spec:
  compositeTypeRef:
    apiVersion: networking.acme.com/v1alpha1
    kind: XThing
  mode: Pipeline
  pipeline:
  - step: patch-and-transform
    functionRef:
      name: crossplane-contrib-function-patch-and-transform
    input:
      apiVersion: pt.fn.crossplane.io/v1beta1
      kind: Resources
      resources:
      - name: secret-ref-object
        base:
          apiVersion: references.upbound.io/v1alpha1
          kind: ReferencedObject
          spec:
            managementPolicies:
            - Observe
            deletionPolicy: Orphan
            composite:
              apiVersion: networking.acme.com/v1alpha1
              kind: XThing
              name: TO_BE_PATCHED
              jsonPath: .spec.parameters.secretRef
        patches:
        - type: FromCompositeFieldPath
          fromFieldPath: metadata.name
          toFieldPath: spec.composite.name
```
</details>

By declaring a resource reference in your XRD, Upbound handles resolution of the desired resource.

## Deploy APIs

To configure routing resource requests between control planes, you need to deploy APIs in at least two control planes.

### Deploy into a service-level control plane

Package the APIs you build into a Configuration package an deploy it on a
control plane in an Upbound Cloud Space. In Upbound, it's common to refer to the
control plane where the Configuration package is deployed as a **service-level
control plane**. This control plane runs the controllers that processes the API
requests and provisions underlying resources. In a later section, you learn how
you can use _Topology_ features to [configure routing][configure-routing].

### Deploy as Remote APIs on a platform control plane

You should use the same package source as deployed in the **service-level
control planes**, but this time deploy the Configuration in a separate control
plane as a _RemoteConfiguration_. The _RemoteConfiguration_ installs Kubernetes
CustomResourceDefinitions for the APIs defined in the Configuration package, but
no controllers get deployed.

### Install a _RemoteConfiguration_

_RemoteConfiguration_ is a resource type available in an Upbound manage control
planes that acts like a sort of Crossplane [Configuration][configuration]
package. Unlike standard Crossplane Configurations, which install XRDs,
compositions, and functions into a desired control plane, _RemoteConfigurations_
install only the CRDs for claimable composite resource types.

#### Install directly

Install a _RemoteConfiguration_ by defining the following and applying it to
your control plane:

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: RemoteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: <your-configuration-name>
spec:
  package: <xpkg.upbound.io/your-org/your-configuration-name:tag>
```

#### Declare as a project dependency

You can declare _RemoteConfigurations_ as dependencies in your control plane's
[project file][project-file]. Use the up CLI to add the dependency, providing
the `--remote` flag:

```tsx live
up dep add <xpkg.upbound.io/your-org/your-configuration-name:tag> --remote
```

This command adds a declaration in the `spec.apiDependencies` stanza of your
project's `upbound.yaml` as demonstrated below:

```yaml
apiVersion: meta.dev.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: service-controlplane
spec:
  apiDependencies:
  - configuration: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/remote-configuration
    version: '>=v0.0.0'
  dependsOn:
  - provider: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-kubernetes
    version: '>=v0.0.0'
```

Like a Configuration, a _RemoteConfigurationRevision_ gets created when the
package gets installed on a control plane. Unlike Configurations, XRDs and
compositions **don't** get installed by a _RemoteConfiguration_. Only the CRDs
for claimable composite types get installed and Crossplane thereafter manages
their lifecycle. You can tell when a CRD gets installed by a
_RemoteConfiguration_ because it has the `internal.scheduling.upbound.io/remote:
true` label:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: things.networking.acme.com
  labels:
    internal.scheduling.upbound.io/remote: "true"
```

## Use an _Environment_ to route resources

_Environment_ is a resource type available in Upbound control planes that works
in tandem with resources installed by _RemoteConfigurations_. _Environment_ is a
namespace-scoped resource that lets you configure how to route remote resources
to other control planes by a set of user-defined dimensions. 

### Define a routing dimension

To establish a routing dimensions between two control planes, you must do two
things:

1. Annotate the service control plane with the name and value of a dimension.
2. Configure an environment on another control plane with a dimension matching the field and value of the service control plane.

The example below demonstrates the creation of a service control plane with a
`region` dimension:

```yaml
apiVersion: spaces.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ControlPlane
metadata:
  labels:
    dimension.scheduling.upbound.io/region: "us-east-1"
  name: prod-1
  namespace: default
spec:
```

Upbound's Spaces controller keeps an inventory of all declared dimensions and
listens for control planes to route to them.

### Create an _Environment_

Next, create an _Environment_ on a separate control plane, referencing the
dimension from before. The example below demonstrates routing all remote
resource requests in the `default` namespace of the control plane based on a
single `region` dimension:

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  dimensions:
    region: us-east-1
```

You can specify whichever dimensions as you want. The example below demonstrates
multiple dimensions:

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  dimensions:
    region: us-east-1
    env: prod
    offering: databases
```

In order for the routing controller to match, _all_ dimensions must match for a
given service control plane.

You can specify dimension overrides on a per-resource group basis. This lets you
configure default routing rules for a given _Environment_ and override routing
on a per-offering basis.

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  dimensions:
    region: us-east-1
  resourceGroups:
    - name: database.platform.upbound.io # database
      dimensions:
        region: "us-east-1"
        env: "prod"
        offering: "databases"
    - name: networking.platform.upbound.io # networks
      dimensions:
        region: "us-east-1"
        env: "prod"
        offering: "networks"
```

### Confirm the configured route

After you create an _Environment_ on a control plane, the routes selected get
reported in the _Environment's_ `.status.resourceGroups`. This is illustrated
below:

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: default
...
status:
  resourceGroups:
    - name: database.platform.upbound.io # database
      proposed:
        controlPlane: ctp-1
        group: default
        space: upbound-gcp-us-central1
      dimensions:
        region: "us-east-1"
        env: "prod"
        offering: "databases"
```

If you don't see a response in the `.status.resourceGroups`, this indicates a
match wasn't found or an error establishing routing occurred. 

:::tip
There's no limit to the number of control planes you can route to. You can also
stack routing and form your own topology of control planes, with multiple layers
of routing.
:::
<!-- vale gitlab.HeadingContent = NO -->
### Limitations
<!-- vale gitlab.HeadingContent  = YES -->

Routing from one control plane to another is currently scoped to control planes
that exist in a single Space. You can't route resource requests to control
planes that exist on a cross-Space boundary.

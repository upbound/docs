Welcome to Upbound, a platform for building autonomous infrastructure platforms
that provision, operate, and adapt without human intervention.

Upbound allows you to expose infrastructure across clouds, vendors, and
systems through a single programmable API surface that works for humans and
intelligent agents alike. Upbound powers this API surface with a **control plane**
called **Crossplane**.

If you're new to Upbound and Crossplane, this section guides you through the
essential resources to get started.

Follow the guides to help you get started and learn how Upbound can help you
build your own infrastructure platform.

For more advanced concepts and scenarios in Upbound, see [Guides][guides].

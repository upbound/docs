Welcome to Upbound, a platform for building autonomous infrastructure platforms that provision, operate, and adapt without human intervention. 

Upbound allows you to expose all infrastructure — across clouds, vendors, and systems — through a single programmable API surface that works for humans and intelligent agents alike. This API surface is powered by a **control plane** called **Crossplane**. 

If you're new to Upbound and Crossplane, this section guides you through the essential resources to get started.

Follow the guides to help you get started and learn how Upbound can help you build your own infrastructure platform.

For more advanced concepts and scenarios in Upbound, see [Guides][guides].

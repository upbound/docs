Now that you've created and run your control plane locally, it's time to deploy it into production. 

## Deploy your control plane in production

The Upbound platform offers several ways to run a control plane in production:

- A [space][space], a hosting environment in Upbound that offers a managed experience for running control planes-as-a-service. You can choose to run in a [Cloud Space][cloud-spaces], which offers a true SaaS experience, or deploy your own [Self-hosted Space][self-hosted-space]. **These options are available for users on a Standard, Enterprise, or Business Critical plan.**
- [Self-managed UXP][self-managed-uxp] installed into a full Kubernetes cluster. **This option is available for users on a Community plan.**

Pick the deployment mode that works best for you to continue your learning journey.

<!-- vale Google.Exclamation = NO -->
Congratulations! You created your first control plane, defined
custom resource types, integrated AI-powered operations, and packaged everything
as a distributable Configuration.
<!-- vale Google.Exclamation = YES -->

Your local control plane now automatically provisions Kubernetes deployments
through your custom `App` resource, detects pod issues using AI analysis, and
suggests intelligent remediation steps. You built the foundation of a modern
infrastructure platform.

## Keep building

Gain more knowledge on with hands-on workshops and tutorials:

**Keep learning with the Builder's Workshop**: [Build custom
composition functions][workshop], handle complex resource relationships, and master error
handling patterns.

**Build intelligent control planes**: Learn to create [AI-augmented control planes][intelligent-control-planes] that adapt and self-heal.

**Create an internal developer platform**: Follow our [Internal Developer
Platform guide][idp-guide] to build comprehensive developer experiences.

Dive deeper into these core concepts:

- [Compositions][compositions]: Learn how resource templating and logic work
- [Project structure][project-structure]: Organize and manage your control plane code
- [Control plane architecture][control-planes]: Understand the deployment architecture


## Deploy to production

When you're ready to share your control plane with your team:

**Upbound Spaces**: [Managed hosting environment][spaces] that
handles operations for you. Choose [Cloud Spaces][control-planes] for true SaaS or Self-hosted
Spaces for your infrastructure.

**Self-managed UXP**: [Deploy into your own Kubernetes
cluster][uxp] with full control.

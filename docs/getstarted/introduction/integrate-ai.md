Upbound Crossplane transforms infrastructure management by integrating
AI-powered pipelines directly into your control plane operations. Through
LLM-enabled Operation functions, you can build intelligent infrastructure
platforms that automatically diagnose issues, suggest fixes, and provide
contextual insights about resource health and dependencies.

Operations allow you to build workflows using function pipelines that execute
tasks on resources under management by your control plane. Operations run once
to completion and then stop, making them ideal for event-driven automation
tasks.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create and configure AI-powered operations
using Upbound Crossplane to automatically detect common Kubernetes
pod issues. This tutorial is for platform engineers and DevOps
practitioners.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* a defined project from the [previous guide][project]
* an Anthropic API key for Claude AI integration
* `kubectl` access to your Kubernetes cluster
* the [Upbound CLI][up] installed and configured

## Grant permissions to your control plane

To get started, make sure you have a running control plane with the necessary permissions.

Launch your control plane if it's not already running:

```shell
up project run --local
```
:::tip
The `project run` command builds and deploys any changes. If you don't have a
control plane running yet, it creates one, otherwise it targets your
existing control plane.
:::

Next, create a new file called `permissions.yaml`. Copy and paste the
configuration below to set up the required RBAC permissions for the AI
operations:

```yaml
---
# log-and-event-reader provides sufficient yet narrow scoped permissions for
# reading pod logs and events related to the pod.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: log-and-event-reader
rules:
# controlplane-mcp-server needs get/list on pods, pods/log, and events
# in order to retrieve information for analysis.
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - events
  - pods
  - pods/log
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
---
# Bind the above ClusterRole to the function's service account.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: log-and-event-reader

  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: log-and-event-reader
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: function-pod-analyzer
  namespace: crossplane-system
---
# analyses-collaborator provides sufficient yet narrow scoped permissions for
# reading and creating analyses.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: analyses-collaborator
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ops.upbound.io
  resources:
  - analyses
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - create
---
# Bind the above ClusterRole to the function's service account.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding

  namespace: crossplane-system
---
# crossplane needs permissions to manage Analyses for correspinding 
# WatchOperations.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: crossplane:aggregate-to-crossplane:analysis-collaborator
  labels:
    rbac.crossplane.io/aggregate-to-crossplane: "true"

rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - events
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
```

Apply the permissions to your cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f permissions.yaml
```

## Configure Anthropic API access

Function-claude sends all requests to your Anthropic account and requires an API
key to work.

Create an [Anthropic API key][anthropic-key].

Create a new file called `claude.yaml` with your API key as a secret to your
control plane. Copy and paste the configuration below and replace `you-api-key`
with your actual Claude API key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: claude
  namespace: crossplane-system
stringData:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "your-api-key"
```

Apply the secret to your cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f claude.yaml
```

## Enable _Analysis_ and _Remediation_ APIs

Upbound Crossplane uses Analysis and Remediation resource types to 
complement AI operations and enable human-in-the-loop intervention.

Enable these resource types on your cluster:

```shell
kubectl -n crossplane-system patch deployment upbound-controller-manager --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-", "value": "--enable-analysis-and-remediation"}]'
```

## Add AI functions to your control plane project

Next, add the required functions and configure the AI-powered operations.

Add the necessary functions to your control plane project:

```shell
up dep add xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/function-claude:v0.2.0
up dep add xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/function-analysis-gate:v0.0.0-20250808233445-b3bb3dafbd25
up dep add xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/function-remediation-gate:v0.0.0-20250808233532-ad1d6ad2aea6
up dep add xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/function-event-filter:v0.0.0-20250808235120-d07a570f15d6
```

Generate the operation templates:

```shell
up operation generate remediate-oom
up operation generate analyze-events-for-pod-distress
```

Next, create a remediation operation by replacing the contents of
`getting-started/operations/remediate-oom/operation.yaml` with:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: WatchOperation
metadata:
  name: remediate-oom
spec:
  watch:
    apiVersion: ops.upbound.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Remediation
    namespace: default
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  successfulHistoryLimit: 2
  failedHistoryLimit: 1
  operationTemplate:
    spec:
      mode: Pipeline
      pipeline:
      - step: can-attempt-remediation
        functionRef:
          name: upbound-function-remediation-gate
        input:
          apiVersion: gate.remediation.fn.upbound.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Input
```


Configure your analysis operation by replacing the contents of
`getting-started/operations/analyze-events-for-pod-distress/operation.yaml`
with:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: WatchOperation
metadata:
  name: analyze-events-for-pod-distress
spec:
  watch:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Event
    namespace: default
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  successfulHistoryLimit: 2
  failedHistoryLimit: 1
  operationTemplate:
    spec:
      mode: Pipeline
      pipeline:
      - step: filter-noisy-events
        functionRef:
          name: upbound-function-event-filter
        input:
          apiVersion: filter.event.fn.upbound.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Input
          type: Warning
          # We're specifically interested BackOff events.
          reason: BackOff
          # Let's make sure this is a repeated issue.
          count: 2
      - step: analysis-gate
        functionRef:
          name: upbound-function-analysis-gate
        input:
          apiVersion: gate.analysis.fn.upbound.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Input
      - step: analyze
        functionRef:
          name: upbound-function-claude
        input:
          apiVersion: claude.fn.upbound.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Prompt
          systemPrompt: |

                ]
              }
            }

            You can suggest multiple remediation strategies. Each array item in the 
            "remediations" array above will correspond to a strategy. Each strategy must 
            have a short description and a set of steps to fix the identified issue.

            name: claude
```

Deploy the changes to your control plane:

```shell
up project run --local
```

Configure the function runtime permissions.

Save the following YAML as `deploymentruntimeconfigs.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: DeploymentRuntimeConfig
metadata:
  name: ctp-mcp

            args:
            - --debug
            env:
            - name: MCP_SERVER_TOOL_CTP1_TRANSPORT
              value: http-stream
            - name: MCP_SERVER_TOOL_CTP1_BASEURL

apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:

  runtimeConfigRef:
    name: ctp-mcp
---
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: upbound-function-analysis-gate
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/function-analysis-gate:v0.0.0-20250804021106-1692dfd80975
  runtimeConfigRef:
    name: analysis-perms
---
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: upbound-function-remediation-gate
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/function-remediation-gate:v0.0.0-20250803235634-0bc0b559a335
  runtimeConfigRef:
    name: remediation-perms
```

Apply the runtime configurations:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deploymentruntimeconfigs.yaml
```

These configurations associate the permissions you created earlier with the
functions deployed on your control plane, enabling them to create and
interact with _Analysis_ and _Remediation_ resources.

## Test the AI-powered operation

Now you'll deploy a problematic workload to trigger the AI analysis.

Deploy a WebApp that will trigger out-of-memory conditions.

Save the following YAML as `oomkilled.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: WebApp
metadata:
  name: oomkilled
  namespace: default
spec:
  parameters:
    image: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/pod-oom:v0.1.0
    port: 8080
    replicas: 1
    service:
      enabled: false
    ingress:
      enabled: false
    serviceAccount: default
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 5Mi
        cpu: 100m
      requests:
        memory: 1Mi
        cpu: 100m
```

This image contains a workload that intentionally causes out-of-memory conditions.

Apply the problematic workload:

```shell
kubectl apply -f oomkilled.yaml
```

Verify the pod enters an `OOMKilled` state:

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

Monitor the AI analysis creation:

```shell
kubectl get analysis,remediation,remediationrequests,operations -A
```


:::note
The WatchOperation `analyze-events-for-pod-distress` manifest above filters events down to:

```yaml
apiVersion: filter.event.fn.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: Input
type: Warning
# We're specifically interested BackOff events.
reason: BackOff
# Let's make sure this is a repeated issue.
count: 2
```

It may take a few `OOMKill` loops for an Analysis to be created.
:::

Examine the AI-generated analysis and remediation suggestions:

```shell
kubectl get analysis <analysis-name> -o yaml
```

Replace `<analysis-name>` with the actual name of the created _Analysis_
resource. The output shows Claude's analysis of the pod issues and suggested
remediation steps.

## Next steps

Now that your control plane is running locally with AI-powered operations, consider these next steps:

* Package your control plane as a [Configuration][Configuration] image and push it to the Upbound Marketplace
* Complete the [Build and push your first Configuration][buildAndPush] tutorial
* Explore additional [AI-powered operations][aiOperations] for other infrastructure scenarios

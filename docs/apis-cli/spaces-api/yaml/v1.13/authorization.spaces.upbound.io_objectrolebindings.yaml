          A ObjectRoleBinding binds a namespaced API object to a set of subjects, at varying access levels.
          For now, there can be at most one ObjectRoleBinding pointing to each API object.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

              Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.

## v2.3.3-up.1

### Release Date: 2026-06-24

#### What's Changed

Based on Crossplane [v2.3.3](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases/tag/v2.3.3).

- **Fixed package signature verification TOCTOU** (GHSA-mf7q-r4rv-jv94): A time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw could let a malicious OCI registry pass signature verification with a signed image and then serve unsigned content for installation. Fixed via crossplane-runtime v2.3.3.
- **Fixed `crossplane render` regressions**: Render now honors input XR schema, returns requirements even on fatal errors, and sets the namespace only for cluster-scoped XRs.
- Security dep bumps: Go 1.25.11, `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/sys`, `containerd` → v1.7.33

#### Action Required

:::important
If you are running Secrets Proxy with additional namespaces configured: after upgrading to v2.3.1-up.1, delete the existing `secrets-proxy-ca` Kubernetes Secret (containing the CA cert and key) from each additional namespace. The controller will replicate the corrected Secret automatically.

#### What's Changed

## v2.2.0-up.4

### Release Date: 2026-04-08

#### What's Changed

Based on Crossplane v2.2.0.

### Breaking changes

UXP used to hardcode some crossplane core arguments in its helm chart. Now they are moved to helm values under `args`.
Those arguments were:
- `--enable-operations`
- `--package-runtime=External`

For most users nothing will change. But if you are setting different `args` in your installation of UXP, you would be overwriting the default values. In that case, if you want Operations and Add-ons to be available, add the arguments above to your list of `args`.

### Crossplane updates
* bumped Crossplane to [v2.2.0](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases/tag/v2.2.0)

### Features

* Added a new [Observability View in the WebUI](https://docs.upbound.io/manuals/uxp/concepts/observability-views/) showing dashboards with the state of the UXP installation and managed resources.
  * With a Standard license, a few more dashboards are being shown including initial metrics dashboards. Note that to support metrics, UXP installs (for Enterprise license only) a minimal Prometheus instance to collect needed metrics from UXP. This behavior can be controlled through Helm values under `upbound.prometheus`. If you have your own Prometheus installed, you disable the built-in one and redirect the WebUI to get metrics from your own through `webui.config.metricsApiEndpoint`
* Added a new [Secrets Proxy](https://docs.upbound.io/manuals/uxp/howtos/secrets-proxy/) capability that allows applications to continue using the standard Kubernetes Secrets API without any modifications, while seamlessly routing secret requests to an external secret store behind the scenes. A mutating webhook automatically injects a sidecar proxy into pods matching the criteria defined in the webhook configuration and secret requests will be forwarded to the [Secrets Proxy Add-on](https://marketplace.upbound.io/addons/upbound/secret-store-vault-addon/v0.1.1) service. To use this feature, apply an Enterprise license and install the Secrets Proxy add-on from the Upbound Marketplace.

<Standard />


Upbound Cloud, [Connected Spaces], and Connected UXP control planes operate on a
consumption-based service model. You only pay for what you use based on
Crossplane Resources and Operations consumption.

This document describes each of the metrics used to define the pricing model
and information to estimate your implementation costs. For more exact estimates,
[reach out to us][contact-us].

Existing customers looking for current consumption and billing
information should visit the [Upbound Console]. 

## Pricing model

Your monthly invoice includes a combination of usages of Upbound Cloud Resources
(Resource-months and [Operations][operation]) and a minimum monthly commitment that
includes support.

All paid pricing plans contain a minimum commitment of Resource-Months and
Operations. Upbound automatically invoices any usage that exceeds this initial
free consumption at the publicly listed prices, subject to volume discounts and
additional credits.

:::important
Partial months are prorated to the day.

### Resource-Months

A Resource-Month represents the reconciliation of one Crossplane resource over
the period of one month. 

Crossplane resources **included** in Resource-Month calculations:

* Claims (XRCs)
* Composite Resources (XRs)
* Managed Resources (MRs)
* Composed Resources - any resource other than an MR managed by a composite
    resource

Crossplane resources **excluded** from Resource-Month calculations:

* Providers
* Functions
* `ProviderConfig` and ` ProviderConfigUsage` resources
* Events

Upbound measures the time a resource stays alive to an accuracy of approximately
one minute.

#### Example

An example for a control plane with 1000 resources for a full month:

* 200 XRs created, each composes 4 MRs
* 200 XRs + 800MRs = 1000 billable Crossplane resources
* 1000 resources = 1000 Resource-Months

:::note
One month equals 730 hours
:::

### Operations

An Operation represents a run of a single, unique Crossplane [Operation]
resource. Unique Operations tie to a resource's UID. Deleting and
recreating an Operation represents 2 billable Operations.

## Plans

Upbound manages pricing plans and billing at the organization level. An Upbound
user can belong to multiple organizations with different billing plans. Feature
availability depends on your organization context.

Upbound invoices paid plans each calendar month. Each invoice resets the
included Resource-Month and Operation count.

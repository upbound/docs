:::important
Beginning with `v1.21.0` and later, you need at least a `Team` subscription to pull a given Official Provider version.  All prior versions are pullable without a subscription. 
If you're not subscribed to Upbound or have an `Individual` tier subscription, you can still always pull **the most recent provider version** using the `v1` tag.

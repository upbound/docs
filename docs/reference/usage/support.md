## Knowledge Base

- Self-service documentation
- Troubleshooting guides
- Frequently asked questions

### About our knowledge base
Our knowledge base serves as a fast-moving complement to our product documentation. Knowledge articles are created quickly, revised by our team members, and immediately visible to help solve customer problems that may not be covered in our main documentation.

While our product docs focus on architecture, getting started guides, and reference materials, the knowledge base covers troubleshooting, workarounds, and edge cases. This knowledge can flow back into our main documentation over time, but the knowledge base allows us to provide immediate help when customers need it most.

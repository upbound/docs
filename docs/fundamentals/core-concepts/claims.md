<!-- vale write-good.Passive = NO -->
Claims are higher-level abstractions that your users can use for self-service
resource deployment. Claims have a simplified structure with fewer required
fields and less configuration because the default values may already be defined
in the XRD and Composition. 

<!-- vale write-good.Passive = YES -->
Claims allow you to:

* Give your users a self-service method for resource management while adhering
  to your organizational policies
* Automatically provision resources with the control plane workflow
* Maintain governance and consistency across your managed resources

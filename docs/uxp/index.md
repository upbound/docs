description: Learn what Upbound Crossplane is and how it works
---

Upbound Crossplane is the AI-native distribution of Crossplane, a framework for managing the lifecycle of infrastructure and applications through a control plane. It lets you do three things:

1. Manage the lifecycle of any resource in an external system through Kubernetes with Crossplane [providers][providers].
2. Build workflows to template resources and expose it as a simplified resource abstraction with [composition][composition].
3. Build workflows to execute jobs on resources managed by the control plane with [operations][operations].

Workflows in Crossplane are expressed as function pipelines written in your preferred language. Use Upbound Crossplane as a control plane to boost productivity, drive security and compliance, and converge on a consistent technology stack built around Kubernetes.

Upbound Crossplane is delivered by the creators of Crossplane and compatible with the open source CNCF Crossplane community.

## Get Started

* [Quickstart][quickstart]  
Learn fundamentals using Upbound Crossplane to manage your first resources with Crossplane in minutes.
* [Core concepts][concepts]  
Learn about Crossplane providers, creating resource abstractions with compositions, operations, and more.
* [Installation][installation]  
Install Upbound Crossplane and set up your development environment.

## Common Use Cases

* **Unified, programmable infrastructure interface** - Expose all infrastructure-—across clouds, vendors, and systems—-through a single programmable API surface that works for humans and intelligent agents alike.
* **Centralized operations, governance, and controls** - Bring operational visibility, policy enforcement, and lifecycle control into one place-—independent of the underlying infrastructure systems.
* **Deterministic and Intelligent Control** - Upbound control planes combine deterministic control (like reconciliation and policy) with intelligent control (driven by embedded AI agents).

## Community and support

* Join the [Upbound Crossplane][slack] community on slack to get help and share ideas
* Visit the [Upbound Marketplace][marketplace] to find packages for your control planes, built by Upbound, software partners, and the community
